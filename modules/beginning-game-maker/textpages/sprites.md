#Sprites

The images for the objects in your game are called *sprites*. The purpose of this textpage is to teach the basics of using sprites in Game Maker.

###Naming a Sprite

Make sure to give your sprites good, logical names. You'll be glad you did as your projects get more complex. Also, I recommend prepending each name with `spr_` to clearly indicated that the resource is a sprite.
