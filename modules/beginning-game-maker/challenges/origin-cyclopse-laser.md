#Origin Cyclopse Laser Challenge

![](http://christensenacademy.org/modules/beginning-game-maker/challenges/cyclopse.png)

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

Your challenge is to create a game where a cyclopse shoots lasers out of its eyeball each time the user presses the spacebar key.

You must do this with the "create instance" action placing the new instance at position (0,0) relative to the stick figure. The laser must come **exactly** out of the eye. Achieving this will require you to edit the origins of both the cyclopse and laser sprites.

**Note:** The quality of the graphics does not matter. What matters is the precision of the laser coming out of the eye. Hopefully, by the time you're done with this challenge, you will have learned a thing or two about the way sprite origins work.
