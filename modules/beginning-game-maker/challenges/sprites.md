#Sprites Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 35 minutes

The purpose of this challenge is to get lots of practice working with different sprites.

###Sprite 1
Create a sprite that has dimensions 200 by 100. The image for this sprite should simply be your name with a transparent background.

###Sprite 2
Download an image from the Internet and load it into a new sprite. Edit the image in Game Maker so that it is exactly 32 by 32 (width and height).

###Sprites 3-7
Create 5 more sprites of your own choosing. Make sure each one looks different and has different dimensions. Also make sure that each one is name appropriately, such as `spr_panda` if your sprite was a picture of a panda.

By the end of this challenge, you should have 7 total sprites. All of them should be named appropriately. Make sure to save your work as proof of completing this challenge.
