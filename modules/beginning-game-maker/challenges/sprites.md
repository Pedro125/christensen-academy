#Sprites Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

###Part 1
Create a sprite that has dimensions 200 by 100. The image for this sprite should simply be your name with a transparent background.

###Part 2
Download an image from the Internet and load it into your sprite. Edit the image in Game Maker so that it is exactly 32 by 32 (width and height).

###Part 3
Create 5 more sprites of your own choosing. Make sure each one looks different and has different dimensions. Also make sure that each one is name appropriately, such as `spr_panda` if your sprite was a picture of a panda.
