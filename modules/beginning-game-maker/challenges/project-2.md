![](http://christensenacademy.org/modules/beginning-game-maker/challenges/project-2.png)

**Estimated Time:** 250 minutes

Your challenge is to take everything you've learned about Game Maker so far and make a game that is genuinely fun to play.

###Basic Requirements
* **Keyboard Movement:** You must use the keyboard to control the movement of the main character(s), which is(are) not allowed to move outside of the screen.
* **Collision Events:** The game must feature the use of collision events, but exactly how this works is up to you.
* **Health or Lives, and Score:** The game must keep track of either health or lives for the player and also display a score.
* **Opening Menu Screen:** There must be an opening menu screen that introduces the player to the game before they actually start playing.
* **Results Screen:** Instead of abruptly ending the game, there must be a final results screen that provides the player an opportunity to replay the game.
* **Randomness:** Your game must feature some form of randomness to keep gameplay interesting.
* **Create Instance:** You must use the Create Instance action in an interesting way. Here are some ideas:
  * The main character shoots a projectile.
  * The bad guys shoot projectiles.
  * The main character can leave mines for bad guys to run into.
  * Health packs randomly appear in the room ever 10 seconds.
