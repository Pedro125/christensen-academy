#Random Numbers Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

Your challenge is to modify the previous game to make the laser come out of the cyclopse's eye at a random speed between 1 and 10. Additionally, you must create a controller object that uses an alarm to randomly end the game 90 to 150 steps after it started.
