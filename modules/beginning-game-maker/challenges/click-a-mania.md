#Project 1

**Estimated Time:** 150 minutes

You've learned a lot about making games in Game Maker, and now it's time to put your skills to good use.

Your challenge is use the major concepts you've learned so far to create an original game. Here are the minimun requirements:

* **Sounds and Music:** Use at least 1 sound effect and incorporate game music.
* **Multiple Rooms:** An intro screen is always a nice touch. You might consider adding a results screen with a "replay" button or something...
* **Alarms:** Hopefully you can find something useful to do with alarms...
* **Controller Object and Score:** Use the controller object for all events and actions that don't pertain to a specific object.
* **Mouse Events:** You're free to use other events to allow the player to interact with your game, but you must use at least two mouse events.
