#Keyboard King

**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

Your challenge is to create a sprite that looks like a king and assign it to an object. Use at least 5 different keyboard events for that object. Each event should have the king do something interesting.

###Example:
* Keyboard Event (Down): Move in a random direction.
* KeyPress Event (Up): King jumps to a new location.
* KeyPress Event (Space): Explosion appears behind the king.
* KeyRelease Event (Letters -> P): A pause screen.
* KeyRelease Event (Letters -> N): Creates a new king in the center of the room.
