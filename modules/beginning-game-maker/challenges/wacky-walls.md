#Wacky Walls

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

Your challenge is to create a basic game with four walls (surrounding the entire room) in which a ball moves around inside the walls. When the ball collides with a wall, "wacky" stuff should happen. It's up to you to decide what you want to have happen once the ball hits a wall. The only stipulation is that you should try to make the actions for the collision event interesting.

**Advice:** Start off with a simple bounce action. Once you've got that, start experimenting with other actions.
