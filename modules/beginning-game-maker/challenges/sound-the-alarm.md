#Sound the Alarm!

**Estimated Time:** 40 minutes

This challenge incorporates two new concepts: sounds (sound effects and music) and alarms.

Your challenge is to modify an existing project in the following manner:

* Add background music.
* Add a sound effect to an object such that the sound plays when the left mouse is pressed over the object.
* Add a sound effect that is occurs on an alarm. Make the alarm "self resetting" such that it goes off every 1.5 seconds.
