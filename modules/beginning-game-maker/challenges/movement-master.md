#Movement Master

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

Your challenge is to modify your game with the cyclopse so that the cyclopse can move up, down, left, and right smoothly and without going off the edge of the screen.

You can accomplish this using keyboard events in combination with the Jump to Position action. To ensure that the cyclopse cannot leave the screen, you can use the Test Variable action.

**Key Idea:** You only want the cyclopse to jump to a new position IF he is still on the screen (i.e., his x and y values are not too big or too small)
