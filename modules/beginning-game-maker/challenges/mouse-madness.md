#Mouse Madness

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

Your challenge is to create a "game" with two different types of objects. Each of these objects needs a mouse event of some kind, and the two objects may not use the exact same kind of mouse event. The actions for each of these events can be anything you'll like, hence this is "mouse madness." The only rule is that you must use at least three meaningful actions for each mouse event.
