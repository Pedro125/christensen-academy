#Mouse Madness

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

Your challenge is to experiment with mouse events until you feel comfortable you understand how they work.

To complete this challenge, you must create a "game" with at least two different objects. Each object needs at least one mouse event.

**Note:** You should experiment using the different types of mouse events. In the interest of learning, you should not use the same type of mouse event over and over.

The actions for these mouse events can be anything you'll like, hence this is "mouse madness." The only rule is that you must demonstrate the use of at least five different actions that occur in response to mouse events.

###Example

When the mouse is released over an instance of object 1, the following actions take place:

* The object moves upwards
* A sound plays
* A point is scored

When an instance of object 2 is clicked, the following actions take place:

* The object moves in a random direction
* A point is subtracted
* A message pops up informing the player of losing a point
