#Mouse Madness

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

Your challenge is to create a "game" with two different types of objects and 2 instances of each object--that is, there will be four "things" in the room.

Each object needs a mouse event of some kind, and the two objects may not use the exact same kind of mouse event.

The actions for these mouse events can be anything you'll like, hence this is "mouse madness." The only rule is that you must use at least three unique actions for each mouse event--since there are two objects, this is a total of 6 actions.

###Example

When an instance of object 1 is clicked, the following actions take place:

* The object moves upwards
* A sound plays
* A point is scored

When an instance of object 2 is clicked, the following actions take place:

* The object moves in a random direction
* A point is subtracted
* A message pops up informing the player of losing a point
