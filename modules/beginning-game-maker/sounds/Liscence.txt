I downloaded these MIDI files from ccmixer.org. I'd like to give a big "thank you" to Morusque for providing these files under the Creative Commons 3.0 BY liscence. The name of the original zip file was "Nurykabe MIDI 01." I have provided a screenshot of the basic liscence info as it appeared on ccmixer.org.
