#Show File Extensions Challenge

Your OS tends to hide file extensions from you in an attempt to prevent you from accidentally changing the extension when renaming a file. While this is undoubtedly a good safety feature for most computer users, I personally find it very annoying. Your challenge is to figure out how to tell your operating system to show you file extensions in file names.

After you're able to see and edit file extensions, try changing one of them and see what happens. Does the operating system warn you when you try to do this? Does your file work anymore? Can you change the extension back to what it was originally?
