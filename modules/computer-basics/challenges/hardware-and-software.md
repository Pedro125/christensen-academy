Figure out exactly what operating system your computer is currently running. Then, figure out exactly what RAM, CPU, and hard drive your computer has.

For example, my computer has the following:

* OS (operating system): Windows 7 Professional (64-bit)
* CPU (processor): Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2310M (2.10 GHz Dual Core)
* RAM (memory): 4 GB
* Hard Drive: 217 GB (66.2 GB Free Space)

What does your computer have?
