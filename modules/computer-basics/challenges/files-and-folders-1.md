#Files and Folders Challenge (Part 1)

The purpose of this challenge is just to get some practice doing basic file operations like cut, copy, and paste.

####Part 1
Create the files and folder structure shown here:

```
- mammalia
  * mammals.txt
  - primates
    - hominidae
      * humans.txt
      * gorillas.txt
      * chimpanzees.txt
      * orangutans.txt
      * gibbons.txt
    - catarrhini
      * stump-tailed-macaque.txt
```

**Note:** Names following "-" are folders and names following "*" are files

**Note:** I've written this text so that children are indented 2 spaces from their parents. Thus, the mammalia folder has two childre: the mammals.txt file and the primates folder. The primates folder has two children: the hominidae folder and the 

**Note:** For the .txt files, just create empty text files.

####Part 2
Using only Cut, Copy, and Paste, reorganize the folder stucture as follows:

```
- mammalia
  - catarrhini
    * stump-tailed-macaque.txt
    * gorillas.txt
    * chimpanzees.txt
  - primates
    * mammals.txt
    - hominidae
      * humans.txt
      * orangutans.txt
      * gibbons.txt
```

**Advice:** Try to get comfortable using cut. It's a lot better than doing copy and paste followed by deleting the copied files from the old location. It's faster, and it ensures that you only have one copy of the file. I've seen lots of students haphazardly copy files into new locations only to end up (accidentally) using the old file in the old location. Having multiple versions of the same file stored in different folders gets confusing in a hurry. Cut helps you avoid this confusion.
