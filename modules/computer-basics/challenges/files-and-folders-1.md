#Files and Folders Challenge (Part 1)

The purpose of this challenge is just to get some practice doing basic file operations like cut, copy, and paste.

####Part 1
Create the files and folder structure shown here:

```
- mammalia
  * mammals.txt
  - primates
    - hominidae
      * humans.txt
      * gorillas.txt
      * chimpanzees.txt
      * orangutans.txt
      * gibbons.txt
    - catarrhini
      * stump-tailed-macaque.txt
```

**Note:** Names following "-" are folders and names following "*" are files

**Note:** I've written this text so that children are indented 2 spaces from their parents. Thus, the mammalia folder has two childre: the mammals.txt file and the primates folder. The primates folder has two children: the hominidae folder and the 

**Note:** For the .txt files, just create empty text files.

####Part 2
Using only Cut, Copy, and Paste, reorganize the folder stucture as follows:

```
- mammalia
  - catarrhini
    * stump-tailed-macaque.txt
    * gorillas.txt
    * chimpanzees.txt
  - primates
    * mammals.txt
    - hominidae
      * humans.txt
      * orangutans.txt
      * gibbons.txt
```

**Advice:** Try to get comfortable using cut. It's a lot better than doing copy and paste followed by deleting the copied files from the old location.
