#Computer Hardware and Software

This is not an in-depth discussion of computer hardware and softare. Rather, it is a brief overview.

##Three Main Parts of Hardware

####House Metaphor
Before delving into a bit more detailed discussion of the three main parts of computer hardware, I thought it might be helpful to examine a nifty little metaphor. I came across a video by Common Craft a couple of years ago called [Computer Hardware in Plain English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrXeDF4Qqz4). I encourage you to watch the video. Here's a quick recap of the main points made in the video:

* A computer is like a house.
* The hard drive is like the basement. It's big, and you can fit all of your stuff in it, but retrieving your stuff from the basement is kinda slow.
* The RAM is like a closet. It's not as big as a hard drive, and it can't store as much stuff. But, retrieving your stuff from the closet is much faster than retrieving your stuff from the basement. Also, while you almost never clean out your basement, you clean out your closet quite frequently (i.e., when you restart your computer).
* The CPU is like the butler of the house who goes around making sure everything is in order and working the way it should. The butler is good at getting stuff done.

###Hard Drive
Your computer hard drive is what stores all of the data on your computer. It stores all of your programs, documents, music, videos, and so on. Most hard drives store hundreds of gigabytes of data. If you plan on storing lots of media like images, music, and videos on your computer, you'll want to make sure your hard drive is big enough.

**Note:** Unlike RAM, a hard drive has a *file system* composed of files and folders. All of the "stuff" on your computer can be found in this file system.

###RAM (Memory)
Like a hard drive, RAM (Random Access Memory) stores data. However, unlike a hard drive, it doesn't store the entire contents of your computer. Instead, it really just stores the data needed by whatever software you have running on your computer. The main reason we need RAM is that retrieving data from the hard drive is much slower than retrieving data from RAM.

If you have lots software running on your computer simultaneously, you may be in danger of running out of RAM. If this happens, your computer will slow down tremendously. If your computer is continously running slowly, it may very likely be because you don't have enough RAM. Whereas a typical hard drive has hundreds of gigabytes of storage, RAM usually only has a few gigabytes of storage.

When you restart your computer, the RAM gets cleared out. Thus, we say that RAM is "volatile," whereas a hard drive has "persistant storage." As the computer starts back up, programs and other data are loaded back into RAM from the hard drive, which can take quite a bit of time.

Have you ever been working on something on your computer and forgotten to save it? Did you lose all of your work? If so, realize that before you saved your work, the changes you'd been making were only in RAM. Only when you save your work does the computer write the data to the hard drive. **Note:** Newer software tends to be more sophisticated and doesn't always require you to save your work; it just does it automatically for you as you go.

###CPU (Processor)
The job of the processor is to run programs. Processors are extraordinarily fast and can excecute roughly a billion instructions in a single second. Processor speed is measured in gigahertz (GHz).

In the past, computers typically only had one processor. In recent years, computers have begun to be built with miltiple processors or "cores". The computer I'm typing on right now has a dual-core processor.


##Software
Without software, computers wouldn't actually *do* anything. Think of software as the instructions computers follow. Software is written by computer programmers. The CPU's (i.e., processor's) job is to run software. 

It can be helpful to think of software as existing layers. In an effort to simplify our discussion of software, I'll pretend like there are just two layers.

###Operating Systems (Bottom Layer)
Personal computers, tablets, and smartphones all have their own operating systems. Windows computers have a version of the Windows operating system, Apple computers have a version of the Mac operating system, iPhones have a versions of the iOS operating system, and so on. The operating system gives the computer its core functionality.

###Software Programs or "Apps" (Top Layer)
Software programs are often written specifically for one operating system or another. For example, if I were to develop an iPhone app, it would only work on devices with the iOS. It would not work with my Windows computer.

Software programs rely on the underlying operating system to function.

We use software programs everyday. Right now as I type this document on my Windows computer, I have the following programs running:

* Notepad++ (my text editor)
* FileZilla (for uploading files to my website)
* Photoshop (for editing images)
* GIMP (also for editing images)
* CMD (the command line utility)
* Chrome (my Web browser)
* Microsoft Word
* Windows Explorer
* Software Update (interestingly enough, some updates for my operating system are ready)

Of course, in the background of all of this is my operating system: Windows 7.
