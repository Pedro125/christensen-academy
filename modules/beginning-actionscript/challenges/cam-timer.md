##Challenge

Enhance your Click-a-Mania game in the following manner:

**Use a timer to determine the length of the game:**

* Remove the main game frames except for 1. **Note:** You may need to move your motion tweens from the Scene 1 timeline into the movie clip symbols for the good and bad buttons.
* Since the main part of the game is now just 1 frame, you'll need to tell the playhead to stop on that frame.
* Create a timer and have it play at the start of the game. It should last for 5 seconds or so and go off just 1 time.
* When timer goes off, the playhead should jump to the results screen.
