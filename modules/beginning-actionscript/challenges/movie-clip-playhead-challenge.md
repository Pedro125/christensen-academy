#Movie Clip Playhead Challenge

* **Challenge:** See below.
* **Estimated Time:** 15 minutes.

##Challenge

1. Create a project with a movie clip symbol.
2. Make sure the movie clip symbol has an animation of some sort in its timeline.
3. Write NO CODE IN THE MOVIE CLIP SYMBOL
4. Add code to a frame in Scene 1 that stops both the Scene 1 timeline and the movie clip timeline.

##Friendly Advice
* Pay extremely close attention to tiny details like capital letters, spaces, and semicolons.
* If you make an error while writing your code, it will show up in the "Compiler Errors" panel wher the timeline normally appears. Read the errors carefully, but realize that it's not always possible to figure out how to fix your code just by reading the error description. Once you've read the error description, double click on it to open the actions panel to the code with the error.
