#Movie Clip Playhead Challenge

* **Challenge:** Create an animated movie clip symbol with a 5-frame animation of whatever you choose. Place an instance of this symbol on scene 1 and extend the frames well beyond 5 frames--the exact number doesn't matter. Give the symbol an instance name. Create an actions layer, and add code to frame 7 that tells both the scene 1 playhead and the movie clip playhead to stop.
* **Estimated Time:** 15 minutes.

##Friendly Advice
* Pay extremely close attention to tiny details like capital letters, spaces, and semicolons.
* If you make an error while writing your code, it will show up in the "Compiler Errors" panel wher the timeline normally appears. Read the errors carefully, but realize that it's not always possible to figure out how to fix your code just by reading the error description. Once you've read the error description, double click on it to open the actions panel to the code with the error.
