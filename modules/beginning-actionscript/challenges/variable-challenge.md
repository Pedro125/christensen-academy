#Variable Challenge

* **Challenge:** See below.
* **Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
* **Purpose:** Imagine a computer game. What types of things does it have to keep track of? Points? Health? The positions of bad guys? All of this data must somehow be stored in the program as the game is played. For storing data, we'll be using variables.
* **Video:** [Variables]()
* **Reference Guide:** [Variables](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/blob/master/modules/beginning-actionscript/reference.md#variables)

##Challenge Description

For this challenge, I've created a video to walk you through the process. Although you could probably complete this challenge just by watching the video and following along, I encourage you to watch the variables video in the playlist to help you gain a more robust understanding of how variables work in ActionScript.
