##Challenge

Enhance your Click-a-Mania game in the following manner:

* Add a motion tween to the first button so that it moves about the screen instead of just remaining stationary.
* Add another button that also moves about the screen. This button will be the "bad" one.
* Make this new "bad" button subtract a point from the score when clicked.
