##Challenge

1. Open the [starter file](http://christensenacademy.org/modules/beginning-actionscript/challenges/four-corners-starter.fla). **Note:** For some reason, Firefox is adding ".txt" to the end of the file. I recommend downloading the file with a Web browser that is not Firefox.
2. Make sure it has a single layer, the Actions layer, with only a single, empty frame.
3. Create an instance of each of the five symbols, placing four of them in the four corners of the stage and the last one in the center of the stage.
4. Create an instance of a sound from the library and play it.

**Reminder:** Instance names should be in camelCase and linkage names should be in UpperCamelCase.
