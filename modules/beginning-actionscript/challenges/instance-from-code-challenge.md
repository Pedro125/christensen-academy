#Instance Property Challenge

* **Challenge:** Follow the directions below.
* **Estimated Time:** 40 minutes
* **Purpose:** Imagine you eventually want to make a game that has a spaceship shooting a lazer each time the player presses the spacebar. This would mean that in your code you would need to create a new instance of the lazer symbol each time the user presses the spacebar. Creating new instances in code turns out to be an exceptionally useful thing to be able to do.

##Challenge Directions

1. Open the [starter file](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/raw/master/modules/beginning-actionscript/challenges/instance-from-code-challenge-starter.fla).
2. Make sure it has a single layer, the Actions layer, with only a single, empty frame.
3. Maker sure each symbol has a linkage name. If not, add good linkage names to each symbol.
4. Add code to this empty frame that creates an instance of each of the five symbols.
5. Make sure these five instances all get added to the display stack.
6. Add code to place an instance in each of the four corners of the stage and one in the middle.

##Friendly Advice

Test often. It would probably be wise to try to create just one instance at a time. This way, if you make a mistake--which most programmers do--it will be easier to find.

Did all of your instances go EXACTLY where you wanted? Take some time to think about the relationship between the position (coordinates) of an instance and its registration point. It will be well worth the effort, I think.
