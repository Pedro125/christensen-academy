#Scene Playhead Challenge

* **Challenge:** See below.
* **Estimated Time:** 15 minutes.

##Challenge
1. Modify an existing animation to skip a few frames using a `gotoAndPlay()` command
2. Stop on the second-to-last frame
3. Print "finished" to the output panel
4. Make sure you feel confident you understand how each of the three commands used in this challenge work. Play around and experiment with the code a bit before wrapping the challenge up. Try inserting more keyframes on your Actions layer.

##Friendly Advice

* Keep all of your code in a single layer called "Actions".
* Pay extremely close attention to tiny details like capital letters, spaces, and semicolons.
* If you make an error while writing your code, it will show up in the "Compiler Errors" panel wher the timeline normally appears. Read the errors carefully, but realize that it's not always possible to figure out how to fix your code just by reading the error description. Once you've read the error description, double click on it to open the actions panel to the code with the error.
