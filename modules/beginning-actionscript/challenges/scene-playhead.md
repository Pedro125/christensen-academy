###Challenge
1. Modify an existing animation to skip a few frames using a `gotoAndPlay()` command.
2. Stop the Scene-1 playhead near the end of the timeline.
3. Print "finished" to the output panel on the same frame you told the playhead to stop.
4. Make sure you feel confident you understand how each of the three commands used in this challenge work. Play around and experiment with the code a bit before wrapping the challenge up. Try inserting more keyframes on your Actions layer.
