* **Estimated Time:** 120 minutes

##Challenge

Your goal is to make a fully functional clock program with both an analog (hour, minute, and second hands) and digital component. For simplicity's sake, I recommend setting the frame rate to 6 fps if you choose to use a frame event. If you choose to use a timer event, you can set things up however you would like.
