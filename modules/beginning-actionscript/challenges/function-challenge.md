#Beginning ActionScript: Function Challenge

* **Estimated Time:** 25 minutes

###Challenge
[This program](http://christensenacademy.org/modules/beginning-actionscript/challenges/function-challenge.fla) has lots of buttons that can be clicked to score points. Think of it as a simple game if you wish. The point of this program is to demonstrate why functions are so important. Your challenge improve this program without changing what it does. You need to rewrite the code using functions more intelligently.

* One function for when any of the outer boxes are clicked.
* One function for when any of the middle boxes are clicked.
* One function for when any of the inner boxes are clicked.
* One function for updating the display of the four dynamic text boxes on the stage.
