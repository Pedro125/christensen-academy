* **Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
* **Purpose:** You'll eventually make games with things like lasers that are created after the game has started. For this, you need to create instances from code.
* **Reference Guide:** [Creating Instances from Code](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/blob/master/modules/beginning-actionscript/reference.md#creating-instances-from-code)

##Challenge

**Goal:** Write AS3 code to create new instances of symbols and place them in the four corners of the stage.

1. Open the [starter file](http://christensenacademy.org/modules/beginning-actionscript/challenges/instances-from-code-challenge-starter.fla). **Note:** For some reason, Firefox is adding ".txt" to the end of the file. I recommend downloading the file with a Web browser that is not Firefox.
2. Make sure it has a single layer, the Actions layer, with only a single, empty frame.
3. Make sure each symbol has a linkage name. If not, add good linkage names to each symbol.
4. Add code to this empty frame that creates an instance of each of the five symbols.
5. Make sure these five instances all get added to the display stack (i.e., use the "addChild()") command).
6. Add code to place an instance in each of the four corners of the stage and one in the middle.


**Reminder:** Instance names in [camelCase](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/blob/master/modules/beginning-actionscript/reference.md#camelcase-and-uppercamelcase) and linkage names in [UpperCamelCase](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/blob/master/modules/beginning-actionscript/reference.md#camelcase-and-uppercamelcase)
