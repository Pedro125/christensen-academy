###The Shooting Star Challenge
* **Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
* **Purpose:** This challenge is about learning how to command instances in AS3 code. Someday, when you're trying to make a game, you'll need to command instances like bad guys, powerups, and so on, which can only be done by writing code.
* **Reference Guide:** [Movie Clip Properties](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/blob/master/modules/beginning-actionscript/reference.md#movie-clip-properties)

###Challenge
**Goal:** Create a frame-by-frame animation of a shooting star by writing code only.

Create a star symbol and place an instance of it on the stage, making sure to give it an instance name. Over the course of at least 8 frames, the star should...

1. steadily decrease in alpha value.
2. steadily decrease in size.
3. steadily move across the stage.
4. steadily rotate.

**Note:** The star should be in its own layer, not the Actions layer. Also, the star layer should have no keyframes, just a normal sequence of frames. It's the Actions layer that will need keyframes. The goal is to animate by writing code, nothing else.
