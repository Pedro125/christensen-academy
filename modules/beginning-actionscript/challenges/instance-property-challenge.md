#Instance Property Challenge

**Challenge:** Use ActionScript commands to create a frame-by-frame animation (minimum of 8 frames) of a shooting star fading into the distance (more detailed description below).
**Estimated Time:** 40 minutes
**Purpose:** We'll eventually be making games, and if we can figure out how to command instances on the stage to behave as we'd like them to, perhaps someday we'll be able to turn these instances in to bad guys, power ups, and so on.

##More Detailed Description of Challenge

The only symbol you need is a star symbol. It should NOT have an animation in its timeline.

The big idea here is that you can write ActionScript code in successive keyframes to manipulate the properties of the instance of the star symbol. The star should start out large and fully opaque on one side of the screen and finish small and somewhat transparent on the other side of the screen. In addition, it should be rotating slightly as it goes.

**Note:** Make sure you give the instance an instance name!

**Note:** The star should be in its own layer, not the Actions layer. Also, the star layer whould have no keyframes, just a normal sequence of frames. It's the action layer that will need keyframes.
