#Reference Guide for Beginning ActionScript

This document has obviously not been created yet. It is currently october 28 2012. I'll be working on it consistently for the next few weeks to finish it. It's purpose will be to create a consise, helpful code reference for people to use as they advance through the beginning actionscript module.

##Intro to ActionScript

If you're navigating this module, it may very well be your first time doing any computer programming. If so, you may be wondering what exactly computer programming is and what the ActionScript 3.0 programming language is. The following is my introductory explanation. Realize, however, that really understanding what programming is requires a pretty deep understanding of how computers actually work. For that, I recommend spending time on the [computer basics module](#http://www.christensenacademy.org/index.html#computer-basics).

###What is Computer Programming
Computer programming is basically just telling the computer what to do. When you program, you write commands for the computer to follow. It's kind of like writing a recipie, but even more precise. There's very little room for error. The computer will always do EXACTLY what you say, and it takes your commands very literally. This leads to all sorts of bugs in computer code where the computer ends up following seemingly nonsensical instruction. Believe it or not, but it's actually possible to command the computer to do the same thing over and over again forever. It never stops; it just keeps doing the same task over and over. This bug is referred to as an infinite loop, and it happens because the computer lacks what we might call common sense. It just does what it's told, no matter what.

The main idea behind computer programs is this: computers are good at following simple commands and executing them very, very quickly. A common computer can execute around one billion instructions (commands) in a single second--don't worry, this doesn't mean that you'll be writing billions of instructions in your computer code! Your job will be to provide good instructions that get the computer doing exactly what you want it to do.

Lastly, you'll find that computer programming requires a lot of logic. Think about the programs you use on a daily basis. They need to adapt and respond to the humans using them. When you click on buttons, things happen. Whey you type on the keyboard, things happen. At some point, some programmer--or, more likely, some group of programmers--wrote code to tell the computer what to do if people click on things, type on the keyboard, and so on. This sort of thing requires programs to have logic. That is, their behavior changes based on conditions.

###What is ActionScript?

ActionScript is the programming language Flash developers use. It was created specifically for Flash, and people don't really use it for any other purpose. It is considered a "scripting" or "interpreted" language because it requires the Flash Player to interpret it. That is, a computer without the flash player installed will not be able to use ActionScript code. This is different from many other programming languages that don't require an interpreter like the Flash Player. For example, Microsoft Word doesn't require an interpreter; it just runs on your computer. Thus, Microsoft Word was definitely not written in ActionScript or any other language that requires an interpreter, such as Python, Ruby, and so on. Most other programs you use on a daily basis are similarly not interpreted. Interestingly, Flash Programs often run in Web browsers that have the Flash Player plugin installed. Many of the online games you see on the Internet are Flash Programs.

In this module, you will learn ActionScript 3.0, which came after--believe it or not--ActionScript 2.0. AS3 (ActionScript 3.0) was created to improve upon AS2. One of the main differences between the two is that AS3 is "object oriented," which is something you'll learn about in another module.

If all of that feels confusing, don't worry too much. The only way to really understand a language is to actually write programs with it. So, let's get started!

###What does it take to be good at programming?

* **Perseverence:** Everyone encounters challenges when programming, even very talented and experienced programmers do. Your success as a programmer has everything to do with your willingness to tackle difficult problems and work through real challenges. I believe Albert Einstein once said, "It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer." The same is true, I think, of all really good programmers. Becomming an expert won't just magically happen. It takes hard work, dedication, and above all, perseverence in the face of failure. This module is just an introduction to programming, but sometimes starting out can be the hardest part.
* **Joy of Problem Solving:** I highly doubt anyone can become a really good programmer without deeply enjoying solving difficult problems that stretch their abilities to the max. The longer you stick with a problem before getting it, the greater the thrill when you finally do.
* **Play and Curiosity:** Great programmers love playing around with code. As they learn, they try new things out on hunches just to see what might work. Even when they get something right, they play around with it a bit more until it stops working again, always learning through experimentation. This is similar to how babies learn to stand and walk. They fall over and over and over again. Eventually, when they finally get it, they don't stop. They keep going just a little bit more until they fall again, learning every step (literaly) of the way.
* **Logic:** The types of problems you'll encounter in programming are very logical in nature. There's a reason for everything, and if you ever feel confused, it's just because you haven't understood things thoroughly enough yet. There's a logic to everything, and your goal is to find it.
* **Creativity:** Programming is an exceptionally creative process. Programmers enjoy designing and building new things.
