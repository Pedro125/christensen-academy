#Fixing Errors
*"Everybody makes mistakes. Everybody has those days." --Miley Cyrus*

###Compiler Errors
When you run your program--ctrl+enter (Windows) or command+return (Mac)--your ActionScript code gets *compiled* and an SWF file is generated. What exactly "compiling" means is somewhat irrelevant right now. Just realize that Flash attempts to find compiler errors before your program actually runs. These errors will be shown to you in the Compiler Errors panel.

**Key Idea:** Compiler errors mean your program won't work correctly. You must **fix all compiler errors before doing anything elese**.

Each compiler error will provide a short description you should read to try to understand the error. Then, **double click on the error to see it in the Actions panel** where you can try to fix it.

**Friendly Advice:** Whenever you need to fix an error, take the time to try to fully understand your mistake. Every error you make is a learning opportunity. If you take full advantage of these learning opportunities, you'll find much more success farther down the road.

###Runtime Errors
Some errors aren't caught at "compile time" and instead appear during "run time". Runtime errors are a little trickier to fix in general because you only discover them when your program actually runs your code. For example, if there is a runtime error on frame 203, you won't even know it exists until the playhead gets to frame 203. These errors show up in the Output panel and can be harder to decipher than compiler errors.

###Logic Errors
The last type of error is a logic error. When your program has a logic error, it runs without compiler or runtime errors, but it doesn't do what it's supposed to. These can be the most difficult errors to fix because Flash won't give you any hints or even tell you that an error exists. If you play computer games, you may be familiar with logic errors already; perhaps you know them as *glitches*.

###Bugs
Programmers often refer to runtime and logic errors as "bugs". Debugging code is a skill all programmers naturally develop as they continue writing programs.
