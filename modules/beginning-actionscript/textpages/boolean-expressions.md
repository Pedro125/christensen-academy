#Boolean Expressions

A *boolean* is either `true` or `false`. Boolean values allow us to use *logic* in our programs. Consider the following bit of code:

```java
double distance = 2.54;
if(distance < 3) {
  System.out.println("Target in Range");
} else {
  System.out.println("Target out of Range");
}
```

The example above would print out "Target in Range" because the *boolean expression* `distance < 3` evaluates to the *boolean value* `true`.
