#Intro to ActionScript
*"Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program." --Linus Torvalds*

If you're navigating this module, it may very well be your first time doing any computer programming. If so, you may be wondering what exactly computer programming is and what the ActionScript 3.0 programming language is. The following is a quick, introductory explanation.

###What is Computer Programming?
Computer programming is basically just telling the computer what to do. When you program, you write commands for the computer to follow. The computer will always do EXACTLY what you say, so you'll need to be very carefull and pay close attention to small details.

###What is ActionScript?

ActionScript is the programming language for Flash. ActionScript can't be used outside of Flash, and Flash content can't be developed with any programming language other than ActionScript. If you want to make games and other interactive things in Flash, then you need to learn how to program in ActionScript.

In this module, you will learn the basics of ActionScript 3.0, which came after--believe it or not--ActionScript 2.0! I mention this up front so that you make sure to always create new Flash projects using ActionScript 3.0. If you accidentally start a new project in ActionScript 2.0, things won't work.

We'll start out writing what you might call *frame script*. The idea is pretty simple; we'll be writing ActionScript code in individual frames on the timeline. We'll be creating a special layer called "Actions" that we'll use exclusively for writing our code in.

Notice the "a" symobl in the keyframes of the Actions layer. This symbol lets you know that code has been written for that frame. To see and edit the code, right-click and go to Actions to open the Actions panel, which will display the code for that frame. Alternatively, you can press F9 to open the Actions panel.

**Side Note:** The Actions panel is an example of what's known as a *text editor*. When writing ActionScript, you'll use the Actions panel, but if you someday write computer code in another language, you'll end up using a different text editor. Unlike Word Processors, such as Microsoft Word, text editors only allow you to edit *plain text*, which is what computer programs are written in.

###What does it take to be good at programming?

* **Perseverence:** Everyone encounters challenges when programming. Your success as a programmer has everything to do with your willingness to tackle difficult problems and work through them til completion. This takes time. You may encounter problems that stump you for 30 minutes, an hour, a day, and even longer! Albert Einstein once said, "It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer." The same is true, I think, of all really good programmers. Becomming an expert won't just magically happen. It takes hard work, dedication, and above all, perseverence in the face of failure. This module is just an introduction to programming, but sometimes just starting out can be the hardest part. Stick with it, and you'll succeed.
* **Joy of Problem Solving:** I highly doubt anyone can become a really good programmer without deeply enjoying solving difficult problems that stretch their abilities to the max. The longer you stick with a problem before getting it, the greater the thrill you'll have and the deeper your learning will be.
* **Play and Curiosity:** Great programmers love playing around with code. As they learn, they try new things out on hunches just to see what might work. Even when they get something right, they play around with it a bit more just to see what happens. This is similar to how babies learn to stand and walk. Babies fall down over and over again as they try to stand. Eventually, when they finally get it, they don't stop; instead, they try to walk, which inevitably leads to more falling. Yet, they keep at it, driven by some strange playful curiosity about the world around them. Never satisfied with their progress, they press on, eventually learning to walk and even run. This, I think, is the way to approach learning programming--with a playful and unquenchable curiosity.
* **Logic:** The types of problems you'll encounter in programming are very logical in nature. The type of logic you'll encounter doesn't come naturally to most people, but the more you practice, the easier it becomes. Have patience and take the time to think logically and reason through different scenarios until you discover the answer. You'll get better at it as you go, but only if you invest the time and energy to really *think*.
* **Creativity:** Programming is an exceptionally creative process. Programmers enjoy designing and building new things. If writing computer programs were something routine and mechanical, computers could probably write their own programs.
