#camelCase and UpperCamelCase
###camelCase
When naming instances, variables, and functions in ActionScript, you should use what's called "camel case", or, as I like to write it, camelCase. In camelCase, there are no spaces all characters are lower case except for the first letters of words after the first. Notice how the capital letters add "humps" like a camel to the names. Here are some examples:
```
missile
flower
badGuy
redHat
smallHammer
fryingPan
flyingSquirrelWithSupermanCape
```

**Friendly Advice:** It's a good idea to make names for your instance, variable, and function names descriptive. It's a bad idea to give names that are hard to remember or confusing.

###UpperCamelCase
When creating linkage names for symbols, you should follow the UpperCamelCase naming convention. Here are some examples:
```
Missile
Flower
BadGuy
RedHat
SmallHammer
FryingPan
FlyingSquirrelWithSupermanCape
```

**Friendly Advice:** It's a good idea to make your linkage names descriptive. If the symbol is a picture of a hammer, you should probably name it "Hammer".
