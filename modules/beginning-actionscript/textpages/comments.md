#Comments

All programming languages have a way to write *comments*. Comments are not actual code. They're just notes programmers leave themselves and each other to explain their code.

Here is an example:

```java
stop(); //this is a comment
```

In the example above, `run();` was an actual piece of code, while `//this is a comment` was a comment. Of course, normally the comment would actually say something useful about the code. The following is a more realistic example:

```java
stop(): // this command stops the playhead
```

In ActionScript, comments can be written in two ways:

```java
/* This comment can span
multiple lines */

// This comment must stay on this line
```

####Should I write lots of comments?
Having lots of comments isn't always good because they clutter up the rest of the code. Most teachers encourage novice programmers to write lots of comments. I don't necessarily agree. My pragmatic advice: do what works for you. Your focus should be on learning programming. If you love writing comments in your code to make things more clear, then go for it. Otherwise, don't worry about writing many comments early on.

I'll be writing lots of comments in my examples throughout these textpages because I'm trying to help you learn. I normally would not write quite so many comments.
