#Semicolons
Semicolons go at the end of most lines of code. The only exception to this rule is for lines of code that come just before blocks of code (i.e., code in between `{` and `}` symbols), such as those used for functions, if statemetns, and other control structures.

```java
if(time>1000) //notice that there is no semicolon here. If there were, we'd have major problems.
{
  gameOver();
}
```

**Note:** Each line of code that ends in a semicolon is technically called a *statement*.

**Note:** In ActionScript 3.0, most of the time your program will still work even if you forget semicolons. This seems silly to me. Why would the language technically require something then not strictly enforce it? As good practice, don't leave off the semicolons. There are a few edge cases where this will cause your code not to work.
