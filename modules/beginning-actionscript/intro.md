#Intro to Beginning ActionScript Module

Welcome!

Now that you've learned the basics of drawing and animating using Flash Professional, it's time to start bringing your "movies" to life. In fact, it soon won't make sense to even thing of them as "movies" anymore because you will be creating interactive products that people can actually do stuff with. Instead of passively watching what you've created, your users will be able to move their mouse, click on objects, control objects with the keyboard, and more!

The [reference guide](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/blob/master/modules/beginning-actionscript/reference.md) should be a helpful resource to look back on as you navigate through this module. You can access it by clicking on [the Christensen Academy icon to the left of the module name](http://www.christensenacademy.org/index.html#beginning-actionscript).

The [challenge map](http://www.christensenacademy.org/index.html#beginning-actionscript), shows the paths you can take to learn how to do CSS layouts.

The [videos](http://www.christensenacademy.org/index.html#beginning-actionscript) next to the challenge map teach the concepts you'll need to understand in order to complete the challenges.

##How to Start

The best way to start this module is to explore the [challenge map](http://www.christensenacademy.org/index.html#beginning-actionscript) for a few minutes. Completing the module mean completing the challenge map. Don't spend too much time looking at the challenge map up front. Just a few minutes should be enough. Once you've got a general idea of things you'll be learning and the type of work you'll need to do to complete the module, click on the first challenge and get started!

Of course, you won't be able to complete the first challenge without learning something first, so you'll need to start using the [videos](http://www.christensenacademy.org/index.html#html-basics) to help you learn. For each challenge, it should be self-explanatory which videos you'll need to watch in order to complete the challenge.

When watching the videos, try not to watch them passively. Pause frequently to try things out yourself. This is especially important for learning to write code. Even if you think you understand, check your understanding by trying to write code yourself. Experiment and play around with the code. Then, continue watching the videos.

Lastly, [reference guide](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/blob/master/modules/beginning-actionscript/reference.md) should be a helpful resource when you get stuck or need to review. Of course, you could always rewatch a video, but I think it's often more efficient and effective to just use the reference guide. You can access it by clicking on [the Christensen Academy icon to the left of the module name](http://www.christensenacademy.org/index.html#beginning-actionscript).

##Friendly Advice

As you progress through the challenges, keep them saved in the same folder on your computer. Stay organized and name your files clearly. At the end of the module you will have built a mini portfolio of your work.
