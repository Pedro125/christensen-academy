###Welcome To The Beginning ActionScript Module

Now that you've learned the basics of drawing and animating using Flash Professional, it's time to start bringing your "movies" to life. In fact, it soon won't make sense to even thing of them as "movies" anymore because you will be creating interactive products that people can actually do stuff with. Instead of passively watching what you've created, your users will be able to move their mouse, click on objects, control objects with the keyboard, and more! In fact, by the end of this module, you'll have created your own unique game in Flash.

* **Active Learning:** When watching the videos, try not to watch them passively. Pause frequently to try things out yourself. This is especially important for learning to write code.
