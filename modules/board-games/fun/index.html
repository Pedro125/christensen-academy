<p><em>It's not about whether you win or lose. It's how you play the game.</em></p>
<p><em>The board game about playing a board game where the winner is determined by who has the most fun.</em></p>

<p>Obviously, Fun (the game) is meant to be fun, but sometimes we lose patience, run out of focus, and our enthusiasm all but disappears. Your goal is simple: manage your <em>Patience</em>, <em>Focus</em>, and <em>Enthusiasm</em> in an attempt to maximize the amount of <em>Fun</em> you have. The game is over when there is no more <em>Fun</em> to be had. The winner is the <em>Player</em> who has accumulated the most <em>Fun</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Fun is about playing a board game in general. If you'd like to imagine you're playing a specific board game, feel free to do so. If you enjoy The Matrix, Inception, or Stack Overflow erros, you might enjoy imagining that you're playing a game of Fun.</p>



<h2>Patience, Enthusiasm, and Fun</h2>
<h3>Patience</h3>
<p>Patience is essential. If you run out of patience, you'll start losing some of your fun. If everyone runs out of patience, the game is over.</p>

<h3>Focus</h3>
<p>Focus will help you have fun, but more importantly it will prevent you from getting distracted.</p>

<h3>Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>Enthusiasm is the main resource that allows you to have fun. Without it, even the most exciting events will do little to help you have a good time.</p>

<h2>End of Game</h2>
<p>The game is over when either everyone is out of patience or someone wins the game by earning 10 VP.</p>

<p>The winner is the player with the most fun. Ties are decided by who has the most VP. If there is still a tie, the players will argue about who had more fun playing the game until and the other players will vote on a winner.</p>


<h2>Player Tableaus</h2>

<p>Shows the amount of patience, focus, and enthusiasm each player has. Each player starts with two of each and has a maximum of 5 (min 0). Each player tableau also shows the turn sequence, has two spots for assets, and shows the turn order.</p>

<h2>Rounds and Turns</h2>
<p>At the beginning of a round, each player must select.</p>


<h2>Worker Placement</h2>
<p>Every player gets to place 2 workers unless distracted (1 worker) or majorly distracted (no workers). The placement of these workers determines the actions the player can take.</p>

<h3>Asset Cards</h3>
<p>Draw an asset card. The asset counts as one of your two assets and will last the whole game unless replaced or otherwise destroyed.</p>

<h3>Aggressive Action</h3>
<p>Draw an aggressive action card. These cards will have a net negative effect on the patience and enthusiasm of other players and will yield a slight positive gain on your own resources.</p>

<h3>Cooperative Action</h3>
<p>Everyone's patience will go up, but enthusiasm and/or focus will diminish.</p>
