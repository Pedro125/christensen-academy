Fun

Game Board, Action Cards, Event Cards, Asset Cards, Player Cards

It's not about whether you win or lose. It's how you play the game.

The board game about playing a board game where the winner is determined by who has the most fun.

Obviously, Fun (the game) is meant to be fun, but sometimes we lose patience, run out of focus, and our enthusiasm all but disappears. Your goal is simple: manage your Patience, Focus, and Enthusiasm in an attempt to maximize the amount of Fun you have. The game is over when there is no more Fun to be had. The winner is the Player who has accumulated the most Fun.

Note: Fun is about playing a board game in general. If you'd like to imagine you're playing a specific board game, feel free to do so. If you enjoy The Matrix, Inception, or Stack Overflow erros, you might enjoy imagining that you're playing a game of Fun.

Patience, Enthusiasm, and Fun

Patience

Patience is essential. If you run out of patience, you'll start losing some of your fun. If everyone runs out of patience, the game is over.

Focus

Focus will help you have fun, but more importantly it will prevent you from getting distracted.

Enthusiasm

Enthusiasm is the main resource that allows you to have fun. Without it, even the most exciting events will do little to help you have a good time.

End of Game

The game is over when either everyone is out of patience or someone wins the game by earning 10 VP.

The winner is the player with the most fun. Ties are decided by who has the most VP. If there is still a tie, the players will argue about who had more fun playing the game until and the other players will vote on a winner.

Player Tableaus

Shows the amount of patience, focus, and enthusiasm each player has. Each player starts with two of each and has a maximum of 5 (min 0). Each player tableau also shows the turn sequence, has two spots for assets, and shows the turn order.

Rounds and Turns

At the beginning of a round, each player must select.

Worker Placement

Every player gets to place 2 workers unless distracted (1 worker) or majorly distracted (no workers). The placement of these workers determines the actions the player can take.

Asset Cards

Draw an asset card. The asset counts as one of your two assets and will last the whole game unless replaced or otherwise destroyed.

Aggressive Action

Draw an aggressive action card. These cards will have a net negative effect on the patience and enthusiasm of other players and will yield a slight positive gain on your own resources.

Cooperative Action

Everyone's patience will go up, but enthusiasm and/or focus will diminish.
