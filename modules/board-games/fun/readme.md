###Catch Phrase
It's not about whether you win or lose. It's how you play the game.

###Subtitle
The board game about playing a board game where the winner is the one who has the most fun, literally.

###Description
Games are meant to be fun, but sometimes we lose patience, run out of focus, and our enthusiasm all but disappears. In this game you are playing a board game where *Patience*, *Focus*, *Enthusiasm*, and *Fun* are actual quantities. The goal of the game is to have the most *Fun* by managing your *Patience*, *Focus*, and *Enthusiasm* as well as by playing *Actions*, aquiring *Assets*, and reacting to *Events*. Each player also has a competitiveness rating that will impact how they have fun. The game is over when there is no more *Fun* to be had.
