##Transform Tool
Once you've selected the objects (primitives, object drawings, symbols, etc.) you'd like to transform, take out the transform tool and examine your options. You can:
* rotate
* skew
* resize

Hint: If you'd like to keep your graphics from distorting, hold down shift as you resize them to constrain the aspect ratio (i.e., keep things proportional).

###Transformation Points
When you rotate objects with the transformation tool, you'll notice that they move about a point indicated by a white circle on the stage. This is the transformation point, and it is unique to each instance on the stage. You can move it with the transformation tool.
