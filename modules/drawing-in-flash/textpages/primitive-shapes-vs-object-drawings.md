#Primitive Shapes vs. Object Drawings
##Telling Primitives and Object Drawings Apart
Primitives show a dotted pattern when selected. Object drawings show a blue box around them when selected.

##Important Facts about Primitives
* Primitive shapes "eat" each other.
* Primitive shapes "join" each other at intersection points.
* Primitive shapes can be combined into object drawings

##Important Facts about Object Drawings
* Object drawings contain primitive shapes. To access the primitive shapes, simply double-click on the object.
* Object drawings can be broken apart into primitive shapes.
* Object drawings do not "eat" each other or "join" each other at intersection points. Each object drawing is completely separate from other object drawings.

##Ordering Objects on the Stage
Assuming all primitive shapes and object drawings are in the same layer...
* Object drawings will always be on top of primitives.
* The primitive currently selected will be on top of other primitives.
* It is possible to arrange objects on top of one another by sending objects forward and backward.
