#Vector vs. Bitmap
Unlike most drawing programs that create graphics pixel by pixel, Flash uses vector graphics, which describe shapes in terms of anchor points and curves.

##Advantages of Vector Graphics
* Small file sizes
* Clean, precise shapes
* Zooming in does not lead to pixelation
* Good for graphics like logos and cartoons

##Disadvantages of Vector Graphics
* Drawing vector graphics requires patience and a greater level of expertise than drawing with pixels.
* Photorealistic graphics are not possible
