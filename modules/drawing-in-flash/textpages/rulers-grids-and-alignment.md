#Rulers, Grids, and Alignment
If you find yourself wanting to precisely align things on the stage, rulers, grids, and the alignment panel might help.
##Rulers
Turn these on through the view menu. You'll be able to drag out guides from the rulers onto the stage, which can be helpful.
##Grids
Turn these on through the view menu as well. Like rulers, grids are there to help you organize your content and line things up correctly.
##Alignment
The alignment panel may be of use to you if you want to ensure that multiple objects are all aligned together.
