#Line, Pencil, and Paintbrush Tools
##Line
The line tool is great for drawing objects of all sorts, especially those with straight lines or simple curves. Very complex shapes, such as the outline of a guitar or a car, can be created with the line tool.

**Hint:** After drawing a line with the line tool, the line can be curved using the selection tool.

##Pencil
This tool creates a stroke wherever you draw. If you want a smooth line created, make sure to have the smooth option selected in the tool options.

##Paintbrush
I recommend staying away from this tool. Realize that all it is doing is creating a shape with a fill (no stroke). There are usually better ways to create shapes. The paintbrush tool is an easy way to create a giant mess.
