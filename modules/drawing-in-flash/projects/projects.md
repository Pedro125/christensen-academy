#Drawing in Flash

Note: The videos on [my website](http://christensenacademy.org) teach how to draw vector graphics in Flash.

The videos themselves could be improved. In particular, they need to do a better job demonstrating how and when to use the various drawing tools effectively. A series of short drawing challenges discussing different strategies would be helpful.
