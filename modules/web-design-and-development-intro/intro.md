#Intro to the Web Design and Development Module
The purpose of this module is less about helping you learn to create awesome websites and more about helping you understand how the World Wide Web actually works.

##Mastery
###Challenges
The challenges of this module are aimed at helping you develop and articulate your evolving understanding of how the World Wide Web actually works. Unlike most modules, this module will require you to do some writing. You'll need to be able to explain, in your own words, the concepts covered in this module.
###Project
The project at the end of the module is for you to actually put a website live on the Internet using an FTP connection.
###Assessment
Assuming you demonstrated mastery on the challenges and projects of this module, you will take an assessment to prove what you've learned. The focus of the assessment will be on conceptual understanding and your ability to articulate your understanding of how the World Wide Web actually works.
