#Web Standards

Web Standards come from an organization called the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and specify how various Web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should work. It's the job of the people who make Web browsers and websites to adhere to these standards. 

The goal of this textpage is to provide some insight into what Web Standards are and why we need them. The intended audience for this textpage is people new to learning about the Internet and the World Wide Web.

###Who Controls the Web?
When talking about Web Standards, it's good start by thinking about the question of who controls the Web. The answer, surprisingly or not, that nobody really controls the World Wide Web or even the underlying Internet. The protocols and standards on which the Internet and World Wide Web are built--IP, TCP, HTTP, HTML, etc.--are entirely open and free for anyone to use.

I like to think about it like this:

* Does anyone have the power to completely shut down the Web or the Internet? No.
* Is anyone fundamentally prevented from connecting to and using the Internet? In general, no. Unless you're in prison or something...
* Can anyone build new networks and connect them to the Internet? Yes.
* Can anyone aquire domain names and build new websites? Yes.

With this said, there are two groups of people who play particularly large roles in shaping the World Wide Web: people who make websites, and people who make Web browsers.

###Web Browsers
Although the Web is open to everyone, we all need Web browsers to use it. But, since nobody really controls the Web, who makes browsers? The answer is that lots of people have been making browsers since the early 1990s. Some of the most famous browsers (past and present) are Mosaic, Netscape, Internet Exploer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

Interestingly, these Web browsers all attempt to render webpages in exactly the same way. That is, webpages should theoretically look and behave exactly the same on all browsers.

In a sense, this is the point of Web Standards: to ensure that webpages render exactly the same on all browsers.

Believe it or not, but Web Standards didn't always exist, and they weren't always followed even when they did. During the first [browser wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars) in the late 1990s, many webpages displayed "Best viewed in Netscape" or "Best viewed in Internet Explorer" messages because the major browsers of the day did not fully adhere to a common set of shared Web Standards. During this period of time, it became abundantly clear that a common set of Web Standards were needed.

The World Wide Web we live in today is a much nicer place than it was 10-15 years ago. Today, the four major browsers--Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer--are engaged in what some might call a second browser war. Each browser is fighting to become the dominant, most-used browser on the Web. Nowadays, however, the competition is being framed by Web Standards produced by the (W3C)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3c]. As the W3C continues to release new Standards for HTML, CSS, and other Web-related technologies, browsers race to implement the latest and greatest features of these Standards.

However, Web Standards aren't just the work of people who make Web browsers. Web Standards are also the work of people who make websites

###Why do we need Web standards?
We need standards because the Web needs consistency to flourish. Webpages need to work the same across all browsers

###Who creates Web standards?
The World Wide Web consortium...
