#Web Standards

Web Standards come from an organization called the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) (World Wide Web Consortium) and specify how various web technologies like HTML and CSS should work. For example, the [CSS 2.1 Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/) details how CSS code should be written and how web browsers should interpret it.

There are two groups of people who need to know about and adhere to these standards:

* Web developers: people who make websites
* Browser vendors: people who make Web browsers, such as Google (Chrome), Mozilla (Firefox), Apple (Safari), and Microsoft (Internet Explorer)

###Why are Web Standards Important?
If browser vendors didn't adhere to Web Standards, Web developers couldn't be sure that the websites they make would work as intended on all browsers. Thankfully, modern browsers tend to to a good job adhering to the standards. In the past, this wasn't the case. During the browser wars of the late 1990s, many webpages displayed messages saying either "Best viewed in Internet Explorer" or "Best viewed in Netscape". Because browsers didn't completely follow a common set of standards, Web designers often had to develop websites specifically for one browser or another.

When web developers don't adhere to the standards, which an alarming number still don't, their websites are likely to behave with unexpected results in some or all browsers. Browser vendors are left trying to make their browsers work even for websites that don't comply with Web Standards. This is not a good situation, which is why there is a strong push from within the web development community for web designers and developers to do a better job adhering to Web Standards and following best practices.
