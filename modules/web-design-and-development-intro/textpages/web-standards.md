#Web Standards

Web Standards come from an organization called the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) (World Wide Web Consortium) and specify how various Web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should work. For example, the [CSS 2.1 Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/) details how CSS code should be written and how Web browsers should interpret it.

Two groups of people need to know about and adhere to these standards:

* Web developers: people who make websites
* Browser vendors: people who make Web browsers, such as Google (Chrome), Mozilla (Firefox), Apple (Safari), and Microsoft (Internet Explorer)

###Why are Web Standards Important?
If browser vendors don't adhere to Web Standards, Web developers don't have any assurance that the websites they make will work as intended on all browsers.

If Web developers don't adhere to the standards, their websites are likely to behave with unexpected results in some or all browsers.

###Who Controls the Web?
When talking about Web Standards, it's good start by thinking about the question of who controls the Web. The answer, surprisingly or not, is that nobody really controls the World Wide Web or even the underlying Internet. The protocols and standards on which the Internet and World Wide Web are built--IP, TCP, HTTP, HTML, etc.--are entirely open and free for anyone to use.

I like to think about it like this:

* Does anyone have the power to completely shut down the Web or the Internet? No.
* Is anyone fundamentally prevented from connecting to and using the Internet? In general, no. Unless you're in prison or something...
* Can anyone build new networks and connect them to the Internet? Generally speaking, yes.
* Can anyone aquire domain names and build new websites? Generally speaking, yes.

###Browsers Vendors: The People Who Make Web Browsers

Believe it or not, but Web Standards didn't always exist, and they weren't always followed even when they did. During the first [browser wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars) in the late 1990s, many webpages displayed "Best viewed in Netscape" or "Best viewed in Internet Explorer" messages. Because Web browsers did not completely adhere to a common set of standards, Web developers were forced to tailor their websites to a specific Web browser, which in those days was usually either Netscape or Internet Explorer. This was a very bad situation, and we're still feeling some of the effects today.

In terms of Web Standards, the World Wide Web we live in today is a much nicer place than it was 10-15 years ago. Today, the four major browser vendors are all fighting to become the dominant, most-used browser on the Web. Nowadays, however, the competition is being framed by Web Standards produced by the [W3C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3c). As the W3C continues to release new Standards for HTML, CSS, and other Web-related technologies, browsers race to implement the latest and greatest features of these Standards.

Thanks to the vast improvements in Web Standards and Web browsers' adherence to them, it is much easier for Web developers (people who make websites) to create pages that work well across all browsers.

###Web Developers: The People Who Make Websites

Getting browser vendors to adhere to Web standards is only half of the battle. Web designers and developers still need to work hard to make sure the websites they build are following Web Standards and best practices. Of course, it's generally in their best interest to do so, but I'm still amazed at how often I encounter new websites that are built not adhering to Web Standards.

To the extent that browser vendors and Web developers continue making strides towards Web Standards, the better the Web will be for everyone.
