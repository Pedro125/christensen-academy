#Web Standards

Web Standards specify how various Web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should work.

The goal of this textpage is to explain Web standards by answering five important questions:

* Who controls the Web?
* Who makes Web browsers?
* Why do we need Web standards?
* Who creates Web standards?
* What incentives to browser makers have to adhere to the standards?

###Who Controls the Web?
Nobody, really. For the most part, the Internet and the World Wide Web are free from the control of individual companies or governments. The protocols and standards on which the Internet and World Wide Web are built are entirely *open*.

With that said, there are a few international organizations such as ICANN and the W3C that play an active role in shaping the Web.

###Who makes Web Browsers?
The first browser was made by none other than Tim Berners-Lee himself, the creator of the World Wide Web, in the very early 1990s.

Browsers that followed were mostly made by companies looking to make some money. Here's a short list of the most important ones with some notes about why each is important:

* **Mosaic (1994-1994)**: Popularized the Web with its nice user interface and use of images on webpages.
* **Netscape (1995-1999)**: Dominated the market starting in 1995 due in part to the fact that it was free for individuals to use. JavaScript was invented specifically to work in the Netscape browser. Microsoft's Internet Explorer eventually beat out Netscape in the "browser wars", and Netscape was wiped off the mat by the new millenium.
* **Internet Explorer (1995-present)**: Eventually beat out Netscape in the browser wars in part because it came pre-installed on Windows computers.
* **Firefox (2003-present)**: An open-source project from the non-profit Mozilla Foundation challenged Internet Explorers absolute dominance of the browser market.
* **Safari**: Apple's browser...
* **Chrome**: 
* **Opera**:

It's important to think about the job a browser from the perspective a company or organization making it.

Willing to accomodate bad code...

###Why do we need Web standards?
We need standards because the Web needs consistency to flourish. Webpages need to work the same across all browsers

###Who creates Web standards?
The World Wide Web consortium...
