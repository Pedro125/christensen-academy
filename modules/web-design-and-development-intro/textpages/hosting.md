#Hosting
We say that a website is "hosted" on a computer with a web server installed. Basically, any computer could become a web server if it had the right software installed  on it. But, for most people, the effort and technical expertise needed to set up their own servers, not to mention the cost, lead them to pay hosting companies to setup and maintain servers.

A simple Google search for "website hosting" will return lots of results for companies offering hosting services. For example, I am currently paying a company called DreamHost to provide hosting services for the Christensen Academy. Essentially, they provide me with the information I need to connect to one of their servers and set up my website, which I do from my computer at home.

As part of their hosting services, DreamHost also helped me find a good domain name for my website, which I was able to purchase for roughly $10 a year. GoDaddy was the Domain Name Registrar that I actually bought the domain name from, but the purchasing process was integrated through DreamHost.

All said and done, using DreamHost to provide hosting for my website cost me a little over $100 this year.

I honestly don't know as much about website hosting as I'd like to, and I hope to continue learning more in the coming years. For now, I hope that gives you enough information to get started if you're interested in getting hosting for your own site.
