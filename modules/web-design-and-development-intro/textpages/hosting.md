#Hosting
We say that a website is "hosted" on a computer with a Web server. Often, companies provide hosting services for developers to use. A simple Google search for "Website hosting" will return lots of results for companies offering hosting services. For a fee, these companies will provide you access to a Web server that you can put your website on.

For example, I am currently paying a company called DreamHost to provide hosting services for the Christensen Academy. Essentially, they provide me with the information I need to connect to one of their servers and set up my website, which I do from my regular computer at home. I'll discuss this more in the FTP section.

As part of their hosting services, DreamHost also helped me find a good domain name for my website, which I was able to purchase for roughly $10 a year. GoDaddy was the Domain Name Registrar that I actually bought the domain name from, but the purchasing process was integrated through DreamHost.

All said and done, using DreamHost to provide hosting for my website cost me a little over $100 this year.

Of course, you could go to the trouble of configuring your own Web server on your own network, but unless you have a good reason for doing so, I'd recommend paying for hosting.
