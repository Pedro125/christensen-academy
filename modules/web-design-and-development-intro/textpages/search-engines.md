#Search Engines

When you send a request to a search engine, such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, and others, the search engine magically returns a webpage full of links to what it feels are relevant websites. The popularity of the World Wide Web is due in large part to the effectiveness of search engines. Without search engines, it would be nearly impossible to find what you're looking for on the Web unless you already knew the name of the website you wanted to go to.

**Interesting Fact:** In the very early days of the Web before search engines, people manually maintained lists of Websites. If you'd like to know more about the history of search engines or about search engines in general, I recommend checking out [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine).

###Crawiling the Web
Search engines make use of special computer programs called *Web crawlers* that act as Web browsers requesting pages from websites. Web crawlers "crawl" the Web in the sense that they follow the links they find on Webpages.

###Indexing
The data Web crawlers pick up from the pages they visit is stored and *indexed* for later reference. Each search engine has different strategies and *algorithms* for indexing webpage data.

###Searching
When someone does a Google search, for example, a google server recieves the search request and must figure out how to respond based on all of the data that had been indexed from Web crawlers.
