#Search Engines

When you send a request to a search engine, the search engine magically returns a webpage full of links to what it feels are relevant websites.

The popularity of the World Wide Web is due in large part to the effectiveness of search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and others. Without search engines, it would be nearly impossible to find what you're looking for on the Web unless you already knew the name of the website you wanted to go to.

**Interesting Fact:** In the very early days of the Web before search engines, people manually maintained lists of Websites. If you'd like to know more about the history of search engines or about search engines in general, I recommend checking out [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine).
