#History of the Internet and the World Wide Web

The history of computers is facinating, and within that history, the evolution of the Internet and the World Wide Web are among the most amazing pieces.

If you're interested in learning more about the history of computers, the Internet, and the World Wide Web, I highly recommend taking this [Coursera course](https://class.coursera.org/insidetheinternet-2012-001) from a University of Michigan professor.

###A Brief History of the Internet
The basic idea of a computer network (i.e., finding a way for computers to send messages back and forth) has been around in various forms since the earliest days of electronic computers (1940's and 1950's). It wasn't until the late 1960's and early 1970's, however, that the real foundations of what has become the Internet were actually created.

The following is a short timeline showcasing some of the major highlights in the development of the Internet:
* **(1957-1969)** In 1957, the USSR launched Sputnik, which prompted the United States to create ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1958. ARPA (later renamed DARPA) was responsible fore developing the ARPANET (first operational in 1969). ARPANET was not the only network of its time, but it is the one that evolved into the global Internet.
* **(1969-1972)** ARPANET grows as more computers across the United States connect to it. By the end of 1972, roughly 30 computers were connected, mostly for scientific and military reasons.
* **(1973-1983)** The number of hosts continues to grow, including hosts from networks in other countries. Other uses for the Internet begin to emerge, such as the first MUD in 1979, a precursor to massively multiplayer online games like the World of Warcraft.
* **(1983)** The movie *War Games* features a high school student hacking into a national defense computer in an attempt to play a computer game. Great movie...
* **(1985-1995)** The National Science Foundation created the NSFNET, which became the "backbone" of the Internet in the United States allowing for high-speed data transfer across the country. Other parts of the world have also developed their own regional backbones.

###A Brief History of the World Wide Web
The World Wide Web can best be thought of as an *application* of the Internet, not the Internet itself. By 1990, the basic infrastructure of the Internet was in place, but common people didn't use it. It was at this time that two new protocols were developed: GOPHER and HTTP. At first, the GOPHER protocol, which provided a convenient mechanism for people to share files over the Internet, was the most popular. However, in 1994--following the release of the first graphical Web browser in 1993 called Mosaic--the World Wide Web (the HTTP protocol) surged ahead. The explosive growth of the Web is difficult to describe. Within two decades of its inception in 1990, the World Wide Web had penetrated nearly every facet of modern life. The Web, as they say, is ubiquitous.

The following is a short timeline showcasing some of the major highlights in the development of the World Wide Web:
* **(1990)** Time Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau built all of the tools necessary for a working World Wide Web--a browser, an HTTP server, and an editor. Adoption of their system, however, was slow. Their intended audience, after all, was researchers and academics like themselves.
* **(1993)** Mosaic, the first graphical Web browser, leads to the popularization of the Web
* **(1994)** "The Year of the Web" sees explosive growth.
* **(1996-1998)** The Web gets commercialized, which furthers its already explosive growth.
* **(1998-present)** Web technologies improve and the Web becomes ubiquitous.
