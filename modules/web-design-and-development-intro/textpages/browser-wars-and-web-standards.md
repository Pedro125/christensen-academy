#Browser Wars and Web Standards

In the late 1990's, there was an intense battle between a company called Netscape and Microsoft. Both companies made Web browsers. Netscape had its Netscape browser, and Microsoft had its Internet Explorer browser. Back then, Safari, Chrome, and Firefox didn't exist.

The story of this battle is less about who won or lost and more about the battle itself. Examining this bit of history will help us answer some very important questions:

* Who controls the Web?
* Who makes Browsers?
* Who decides how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should work?
* What incentives to browser makers have to follow the rules?

In this sense, the Web is an "open platform". But, if the Web is open, who controls it? Who decides how it works? Who builds the hardware and software that make it work?

###Mosaic: The First Popular Web Browser
The first popular Web browser was created in 1993. It was called Mosaic, and many point to it as the reason for the Web's explosive growth in 1994.

This happened a few years before the browser wars started. I mention it here to point out that before Mosaic, images didn't display on Webpages. The makers of Mosaic essentially broke the rules and did their own thing. People used their product because it gave them what they wanted...
