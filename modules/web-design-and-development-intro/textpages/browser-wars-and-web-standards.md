#Web Standards
In the late 1990's, there was an intense battle between two companies--Netscape and Microsoft--to dominate the Web browser market.

* It didn't have the ability display pictures on webpages.

These two things were quite possibly related.

This happened a few years before the browser wars started. I mention it here to point out that before Mosaic, images didn't display on Webpages. The makers of Mosaic essentially broke the rules and did their own thing. People used their product because it gave them what they wanted...
