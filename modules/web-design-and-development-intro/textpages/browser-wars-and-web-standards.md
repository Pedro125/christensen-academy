#Browser Wars and Web Standards

In the late 1990's, there was an intense battle between a company called Netscape and Microsoft. Both companies made Web browsers. Netscape had its Netscape browser, and Microsoft had its Internet Explorer browser. Back then, Safari, Chrome, and Firefox didn't exist.

The story of this battle is less about who won or lost and more about the battle itself. Examining this bit of history will help us answer some very important questions:

* Who controls the Web?
* Who makes Browsers?
* Who decides how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should work?
* What incentives to browser makers have to follow the rules?

##Prelude to the Browser Wars
###An Open Platform
The protocols surrounding the Internet and the World Wide Web are almost all non-proprietary. That is, no company or government owns them, and everyone has full access to knowing how they work. Everyone is free to create devices that use these protocols.

With regards specifically to the Web, the HTTP protocol is completely open, as are the specifications for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bunch of other Web-related technologies. Said another way, nobody *owns* these technologies, and everyone is free to use them as they please. 

In my mind, the developers of these technologies are modern society's unsung heros. Names like Vint Cerf and Tim-Berners Lee are not the household names they ought to be. These are men who had the vision and wisdom to build an open platform that all society could benefit from.

But if the Web is open, who controls it? Who shapes its future?
