#Browser Wars and Web Standards

In the late 1990's, there was an intense battle between a company called Netscape and Microsoft. Both companies made Web browsers. Netscape had its Netscape browser, and Microsoft had its Internet Explorer browser. Back then, Safari, Chrome, and Firefox didn't exist.

The story of this battle is less about who won or lost and more about the battle itself. Examining this bit of history helps us answer some very important questions:

* Who controls the Web?
* Who makes Browsers?
* Who decides how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should work?
* What incentives to browser makers have to follow the rules.
