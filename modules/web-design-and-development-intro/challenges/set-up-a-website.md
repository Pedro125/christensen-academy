#Set Up a Website
Your challenge is to find set up a webite following these general steps:

1. Search for hosting
2. Purchase a domain name (possibly through the hosting service)
3. Purchase hosting if necessary
4. Download File Zilla (or a similar program) for FTP
5. Locate the FTP info for your server (your hosting service should provide this) and upload your website files to the server.

**Note:** If you don't have any website files, you can just upload [a simple HTML file](https://raw.github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/master/modules/web-design-and-development-intro/resources/index.html). Just click that link to download the HTML file, then use your FTP program to put it on the Web server.
