#JavaScript Basics Reference

##JavaScript is NOT Java
JavaScript and Java are two very different programming languages. The fact that their names are similar is not coincidence, but it is terribly misleading. Just realize that if you go running around telling people you know Java when what you really mean is that you're starting to learn JavaScript, you'll look like you don't have a clue what you're talking about. Realize that learning any programming language is a major endeavor, and the purpose of this module is just to serve as an introduction.

###What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting language we use to enhance our webpages. Similar to CSS, we can write it inline with individual elements, embedded within `<script></script>` tags, or in external files that we link to from our HTML file. Just like HTML and CSS, JavaScript is interpreted by the browser. However, unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript is a programming language. Although you've been writing a lot of code with HTML and CSS, you weren't really programming in a traditional sense. Programming languages like JavaScript allow you to specify a set of precise steps you want the computer to follow. We sometimes call these precise sets of steps *algorithms*.

Your goal writing JavaScript will be to command your webpages to do interesting and useful things like the following:

##Client-Side Scripting
JavaScript is used for "client-side scripting." This phrase refers to the fact that web browsers interpret JavaScript code, and since browsers run on client computers (as opposed to servers), we refer to JavaScript code as being "client-side." "Server-side" code, on the other hand, will run on a Web server. For example, think of how facebook is able to give each and every person who visits their site a unique webpage. The webpages you see from facebook are not static HTML files. Rather, they are dynamically generated HTML files unique to each user. Information you see on a facebook page is being pulled from databases that live on the "server-side" of the World Wide Web. This is able to happen because Web developers have written server-side code to do it. In this module, we won't worry about doing anything fancy on the server side. Instead, we'll be content to learn how to use JavaScript to make our webpages behave in interesting ways.

##Server-Side JavaScript
JavaScript can actually be used outside of the browser, but this is rare. Most JavaScript is written in the same way you'll write it in this module.
