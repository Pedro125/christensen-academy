#Basic ActionScript
###Using ActionScript to Control Animation Playback

The true power of Flash is in ActionScript. I lead students through an example of using ActionScript to control the playback of their last project (for me, this is the bouncing ball example). Then, students go out and learn about somewhat tangential topics in Flash, such as the bone tool. Each student then creates an animation using what they've learned, applies ActionScript to control the playback, and shares his or her work with the class.

* Butterflies (flapping wings, flying around the screen, causing general mayhem...)
* Cars (driving around, wheels spinning)
* Talking (mouth moving up and down, eyebrows changing to show expressions ... think South Park...)

Note: My videos on [my website](http://christensenacademy.org) teach how to do all of this stuff.
