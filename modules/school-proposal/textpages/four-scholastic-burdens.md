#The Four Scholastic Burdens

My thinking on education has been greatly clarified through attempting to answer the following question: "What purposes do schools serve in society?"

My pondering has lead me to identify five major societal purposes for schools. Interestingly, I've come to see each of these purposes as a burden on the back of schools. It seems to me that society is asking an aweful lot of schools, and we might be wise to seek ways to lighten the load.

Enter: The Four Scholastic Burdens

###Burden 1: Education

1. We need educated people capable of doing sophisticated work.
2. People also need a baseline education level to be able to function in society.
3. In some sense, democracy relies on an educated populace.

###Burden 2: Credentialing

1. We need an accurate, trustworthy system to communicate people's education.
2. We need a fair system that allows people to earn credentials based on merit.

The way the current system is structured is inaccurate, not particularly trustworthy, and serves more and more to divide society rather than unite it. 

The true American dream has never been a family in a house in the suburbs. The true American dream has always been the idea that you can succeed in this world on talent and hard work alone

###Burden 3: Advancement of Human Civilization

1. We need a system that encourages the best and brightest to push the boundaries of the great sphere of human knowledge.
2. We need a system that allows the best and brightest to flourish from a young age.

###Burden 4: Community

What is society if not just a bunch of interconnected communities? There's no denying that school communities play a massive role in the functioning of modern society. Society relies on these communities to be strong.

No matter what metric we use to measure the strength of a school community, I highly doubt we can make a reasonable argument that school communities in general should be considered "strong".
