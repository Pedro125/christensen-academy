#Intro to CSS Layouts Module

Welcome!

Now that you've learned some basic HTML and CSS, it looks like you're ready for a bigger challenge! I know just the thing: CSS layouts.

The purpose of this module is to you learn how to create page layouts like those found on [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). The [challenge map](http://www.christensenacademy.org/index.html#css-layouts), shows the paths you can take to learn how to do CSS layouts. The videos next to the challenge map teach the concepts you'll need to understand in order to complete the challenges.

The [reference guide](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/blob/master/modules/css-layouts/reference.md) should be a helpful resource to look back on as you navigate through this module.

##How to Succeed in this Module

###Experiment, Experiment, Experiment!
You'll be learning various CSS concepts that can be rather tricky. You'll never fully understand these concepts unless you take the time to challenge your own understanding. When you think you know something, try it. When something doesn't work, keep experimenting. When something *does* work, don't immediately move on. Change the code a bit. See if it still works. If it does, change the code further until it doesn't work. Once you've convinced yourself that you really understand what you've done, you're ready to move on. 

**Note:** Experimenting takes time. Don't rush. Real learning doesn't just happen, and people who try to go too fast often end up with holes in their knowledge that give them big troubles later on.

###Research
I hope my videos are good and helpful, but they're not the only way to learn, and their certainly not the only resource around. Becoming a proficient "googler" is well worth your effort. There are good resources online to help you learn this stuff if you're stuck, and finding these resources can be easier than you might expect.

###Collaborate
I guarantee that at some point in this module you'll get stuck. You'll be working on a challenge and all of a sudden you won't be able to get something to work, and you'll have no idea why. When this happens, don't be afraid to ask someone else to take a look at your code and help you find your error. Getting a fresh set of eyes can be tremendously helpful. Even if that person can't find the error, sometimes just getting someone to look at your code helps you look at the problem in a new way. If I had a nickel for every time a student asked me for help only to discover their own mistake just as I approached...

On the flip side of that, take pride in being a great teacher. If other people are having difficulties and you think you might be able to help, then help them. I think we often underestimate how much better we learn things when we have to teach them to others. Collaboration is a win-win situation. Everybody learns more.

##How to Complete the Module
Hopefully you'll find the challenges and projects of this module to be helpful learning experiences, but they also partly serve as evidence of your learning. The projects in particular should serve as especially strong evidence because they challenge you to apply your learning in new, creative ways.

Make sure to keep your completed challenges and projects organized. At the end of the module, they'll form a portfolio of sorts, which will in turn serve as an application for completion of the module. If your portfolio is deemed by the teacher to demonstrate sufficient proficiency, you'll be given one final assessment, which, if you can demonstrate mastery on it, will officially allow you to complete the module. The nature of the assessment will vary at the teacher's discretion but will likely be some combination of traditional written exam and performance assessment (i.e., real code writing on the computer).
