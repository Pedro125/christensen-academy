#CSS Positioning Intro

Considering what you already know about the CSS box model (i.e., that all elements are really boxes with width, height, padding, border, and margin), the next step is to start moving these boxes into different *positions* to create interesting page layouts.

There are several positioning techniques to learn, such as floats, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. Learning how to use these thechniques can be a bit tricky. Personally, I think these techniques are best understood in terms of how they deviate from what's called "normal flow." The purpose of this textpage is to discuss normal flow and provide an introductory description of how each type of positioning deviates from normal flow.

##Normal Flow
In the absense of fancy CSS that alters the positioning of elements (boxes), elements display in "normal flow." Basically, normal flow is what you're accustomed to working with when you create webpages. If you think about it, the rules of normal flow are surprisingly simple:

* Each block-level element (box) displays as far up and to the left as it possibly can. Consider this [jsFiddle]().

###Relative Positioning Intro
This is the easiest type of positioning to understand because the relatively positioned element is simply shifted from its regular position. This has absolutely no impact on the surround elements, which makes relative positioning the most straightforward type of positioning.

###Absolute Positioning Intro
This is the easiest type of positioning to understand because the relatively positioned element is simply shifted from its regular position. This has absolutely no impact on the surround elements, which makes relative positioning the most straightforward type of positioning.
