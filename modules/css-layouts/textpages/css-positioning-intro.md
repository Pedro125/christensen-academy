#CSS Positioning Intro

Considering what you already know about the CSS box model (i.e., that all elements are really boxes with width, height, padding, border, and margin), the next step is to start moving these boxes into different *positions* to create interesting page layouts.

##Normal Flow
There are several positioning techniques to learn--namely, floats, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. Learning how to use these thechniques can be a bit tricky. Personally, I think these techniques are best understood in terms of how they deviate from what's called "normal flow."

###Relative Positioning Intro
This is the easiest type of positioning to understand because the relatively positioned element is simply shifted from its regular position. This has absolutely no impact on the surround elements, which makes relative positioning the most straightforward type of positioning.

This is the easiest type of positioning to understand because the relatively positioned element is simply shifted from its regular position. This has absolutely no impact on the surround elements, which makes relative positioning the most straightforward type of positioning.
