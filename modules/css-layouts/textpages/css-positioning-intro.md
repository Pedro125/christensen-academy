#CSS Positioning Intro

Considering what you already know about the CSS box model (i.e., that all elements are really boxes with width, height, padding, border, and margin), the next step is to start moving these boxes into different *positions* to create interesting page layouts.

There are several positioning techniques to learn, such as floats, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. Learning how to use these thechniques can be a bit tricky. Personally, I think these techniques are best understood in terms of how they deviate from "normal flow." The purpose of this textpage is to provide an introductory description of how each type of positioning deviates from normal flow. Basically, normal flow is what you're accustomed to working with when you create webpages. In the absense of fancy CSS that alters the positioning of elements (boxes), elements display in "normal flow." 

###Relative Positioning Intro
This is the easiest type of positioning to understand because the relatively positioned element is simply shifted from its regular position. This has absolutely no impact on the surround elements, which makes relative positioning the most straightforward type of positioning.

This is the easiest type of positioning to understand because the relatively positioned element is simply shifted from its regular position. This has absolutely no impact on the surround elements, which makes relative positioning the most straightforward type of positioning.
