#Position Relative

Elements that are positioned relatively shift out of their normal flow position leaving an empty space behind. The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties are used to move the relatively positioned element.

```css
position: relative;
top: 20px;
right: 20px;
/* other possible properties include bottom and left */
```
