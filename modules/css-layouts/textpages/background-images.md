#Background Images
Instead of (or in addition to) background colors, you can use background images on your webpages. [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) makes extensive use of background-images.

You can get a background image to display by using the `background-image` CSS property. The value for this property is essentially just the path to the image file you want to use, though you have to remember to place the path inside of the quotes in `url("")`.

```css
background-image: url("lorem.png");
```

Using a background image allows you to put other content over the top.
