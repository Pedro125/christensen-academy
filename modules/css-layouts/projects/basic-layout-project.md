#Basic Layout Project

* **Goal:** Create a unique webpage using what you've learned about the CSS box model.
* **Content:** The focus should be on the style of the page, not the content. Because of this, I recommend using lorem ipsum text for all of the content. For images, I recommend sticking with abstract art that fits with your color scheme.
* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes.

##Rurbric

* **Consistent Color Theme:** Hopefully it's obvious that you chose your colors carefully.
* **Creativity / Uniqueness:** It should be clear that you experimented and tried new, innovative ways of manipulating the CSS box model.
* **Parents and Children:** You made effective use of parent-child relationships on your page.
* **Centering:** You used at least one centered element on your page.
* **Margins:** You used margins effectively. This does NOT mean that all elements should have margins. In fact, it might mean that you set margins to zero where they would have existed by defaut.
* **Borders:** You used borders effectively. This does NOT mean that all elements should have borders.
* **Padding:** You used padding where appropriate to add some separation between the content and borders of elements.
* **Percents and Pixels:** You gave careful thought to what properties had fixed (pixel) values and what properties had fluid (percent) values.
