#Parents (Boxes in Boxes) Challenge

Your challenge is make a webpage (shown below) that exercises your understanding of parent and child elements.

##Prerequisite Knowledge

I recommend you watch videos on the following topics before you attempt this challenge:

* Span vs. Div
* Width and Height
* Margins
* Centering Elements with Auto Margins
* Padding
* Borders

##Make a Webpage that Looks like This 

![This picture shows what your page should look like](https://raw.github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/master/modules/css-layouts/challenges/parents-challenge.png)

###What the Picture doesn't Show

When you think about it, it's actually pretty amazing how little the picture above actually shows about the webpage. Many of the elements on the page will adapt as the size of the browser window adjusts as demonstrated in [this video]().

##Friendly Advice
While you should focus on precise replication of the picture above, don't forget to experiment as you go. Even if you miraculously get things to work the first time around, test yourself and your knowledge of how the box model works by trying something different. Take time to play around with things and really figure out how they work.

##Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Parents (Boxes in Boxes) Challenge</title>
    <style>
      body { 
        margin: 0; /* The body element has margins by default. I like to turn them off. */
        background: #ccc;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>

```

##Solution Video
I haven't made this yet, but I plan on making a video where I complete the challenge myself and talk through how I would do it.
