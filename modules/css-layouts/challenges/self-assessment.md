#CSS Layouts Self Assessment

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

1. All CSS properties have initial (i.e., default) values. The default values for the `width` and `height` properties are `auto`.
  * Describe how (block-level) elements with `width:auto` display.
  * Describe how (block-level) elements with `height:auto` display.
3. True or False? The CSS box model does not apply to inline elements.
4. Which of the following is correct CSS code to give an element no padding on top, 2 pixels of padding on the right, 8 pixels of padding on the bottom, and another 2 pixels of padding on the left?
  * `padding: 0 2px 8px 2px;`
  * `padding: 0 2px; padding-bottom: 8px;`
  * `padding: 2px; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 8px;`
  * none of the above.
5. Assume the width of the browser window is currently 900px. If an element (a child of the body element) has a width of 50%, 5 pixel margins, a 5 pixels border, and 10 pixel padding, how much horizontal space (in pixels) would the element take up on the screen?
  * 450px
  * 470px
  * 480px
  * 490px
6. If you want to center a element (i.e., a block-level element) inside of its parent, what should you do?
  * set the parent's left and right padding to "auto"
  * set the child's left and right margins to "auto"
  * set the child's left and right margins each to "50%"
  * all of the above work just fine
