* **Challenge:** Carefully answer the questions and check your work by watching the solution video.
* **Estimated Time:** 15 minutes.

##Prerequisite Knowledge

I recommend you watch [videos](http://christensenacademy.org/index.html#css-layouts) on the following topics before you attempt this challenge:

##The Questions
Answer the following questions to the best of your ability. Then, watch the solution video to see if you were right.

1. Which of the three types of CSS can be used to manipulate the CSS box model?
  * inline
  * embedded
  * external
  * all of the above
2. By default, the width and the height of elements is set to "auto" for block-level elements, what does this actually mean?
  * Block-level elements are as wide as possible and as tall as necessary based on what's inside them.
  * Block-level elements are as narrow as possible based on what's inside of them. Likewise, they are only as tall as necessary.
  * Block-level elements are as wide as possible and as tall as possible. 
  * None of the above.
3. True or False? The CSS box model does not apply to inline elements.
4. Which of the following is correct CSS code to give an element no padding on top, 2 pixels of padding on the right, 8 pixels of padding on the bottom, and another 2 pixels of padding on the left?
  * `padding: 0 2px 8px 2px;`
  * `padding: 0 2px; padding-bottom: 8px;`
  * `padding: 2px; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 8px;`
  * none of the above.
5. Assume the width of the browser window is currently 900px. If an element (a child of the body element) has a width of 50%, 5 pixel margins, a 5 pixels border, and 10 pixel padding, how much horizontal space (in pixels) would the element take up on the screen?
  * 450px
  * 470px
  * 480px
  * 490px
6. If you want to center a element (i.e., a block-level element) inside of its parent, what should you do?
  * set the parent's left and right padding to "auto"
  * set the child's left and right margins to "auto"
  * set the child's left and right margins each to "50%"
  * all of the above work just fine

##Solution Video
I haven't made this yet, but I plan on making a video where I complete the challenge myself and talk through how I would do it.
