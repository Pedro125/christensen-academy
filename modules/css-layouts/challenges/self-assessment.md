#CSS Layouts Self Assessment

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

1. All CSS properties have initial (i.e., default) values. The default values for the `width` and `height` properties are `auto`.
  * Describe how (block-level) elements with `width:auto` display.
  * Describe how (block-level) elements with `height:auto` display.
2. If you see a box inside of a box on a webpage, what does that tell you about the relationship between the corresponding elements in the HTML?
3. You want an element to have no padding on top, 2 pixels of padding on the right, 8 pixels of padding on the bottom, and another 2 pixels of padding on the left.
  * Write four separate CSS declarations (i.e., property-value pairs) to accomplish this.
  * Write a single CSS declaration to accomplish this.
4. If you want to center an element, what should you do?
5. What is the difference between an element having `width:auto` and `width:100%`? Please support your answer with a concrete example.
6. The width of the browser window is currently 900px. If an element (a child of the body element) has a width of 50%, 5 pixel margins, a 5 pixels border, and 10 pixel padding, how much horizontal space (in pixels) would the element take up on the screen? That is, what would the distance from the outer edge of the the left margin to the outer edge of the right margin be? You should assume that the default 8px margin on the body is in effect.
