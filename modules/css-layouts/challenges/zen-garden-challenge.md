#Zen Garden Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 150 minutes

Your Challenge is to analyze the source code of one of the [CSS Zen garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) pages that you find interesting.

You should first save the HTML and the CSS for that page to your computer. Then, you should engage in a careful analysis of how the page is layed out using CSS. I recommend inspecting the page in the browser using developer tools. As you try to get a feel for how everything works, you should start to play around with the source code. Make some changes to the CSS and see how that affects the page.

Continue playing around with the page until you feel confident that you could explain to someone how and why the CSS for the page layout actually works.
