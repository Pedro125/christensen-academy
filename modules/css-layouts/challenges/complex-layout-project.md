#Complex Layout Project

* **Goal:** Your goal is to create a CSS layout that is used across all pages (at least 3) of your website.
* **Purpose:** Deepen understanding of CSS layouts while creating a meaningful product.
* **Content:** I encourage you to improve upon a site you've previously created. If you're starting from scratch, see the suggested ideas below. If you want to stick to using lorem ipsum, that's fine too.
* **Estimated Time:** 200 minutes.

###Rurbric

* **Consistent Color Theme:** Hopefully it's obvious that you chose your colors carefully.
* **Creativity / Uniqueness:** It should be clear that you experimented and tried new, innovative ways of manipulating the CSS box model.
* **Parents and Children:** You made effective use of parent-child relationships on your page.
* **Margins:** You used margins effectively. This does NOT mean that all elements should have margins. In fact, it might mean that you set margins to zero where they would have existed by defaut.
* **Borders:** You used borders effectively. This does NOT mean that all elements should have borders.
* **Padding:** You used padding where appropriate to add some separation between the content and borders of elements.
* **Percents and Pixels:** You gave careful thought to what properties had fixed (pixel) values and what properties had fluid (percent) values.
* **Background Images:** You've used background images (at least one) effectively.
* **Menu:** You have a clear navigation structure that is **the same** from page to page.
* **Columns:** You have used either floating elements or absolute positioning to achieve a 2- or 3-column layout somewhere on your page.

###Friendly Advice

1. Use external CSS.
2. Create the layout for one page first. Then, simply copy and paste the HTML to the other pages making modifications where appropriate.
3. Plan out your layout on paper before trying to code it.
4. Write your HTML before you write your CSS.
