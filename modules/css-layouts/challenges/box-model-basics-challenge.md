#Box Model Basics Challenge

Your challenge is make a webpage (shown below) that exercises your understanding of the CSS box model.

##Prerequisite Knowledge

I recommend you watch videos on the following topics before you attempt this challenge.

* Span vs. Div
* Margins
* How to center an element using margins
* Padding
* Background Colors
* Border

##Make a Webpage that Looks like This 

![This picture shows what your page should look like](https://raw.github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/master/modules/css-layouts/challenges/box-model-basics-challenge.png)

###What the Picture doesn't Show

When you think about it, it's actually pretty amazing how little the picture above actually shows about the webpage. Many of the elements on the page will adapt as the size of the browser window adjusts as demonstrated in [this video]().

##Keys to Mastery
While you should focus on precise replication of the picture above, don't forget to experiment as you go. Even if you miraculously get things to work the first time around, test yourself and your knowledge of how the box model works by trying something different. Take time to play around with things and really figure out how they work.

##Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Box Model Basics</title>
    <style>
      body { 
        margin: 0; /* The body element has margins by default. I like to turn them off. */
        background: #ccc;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>
    <p>Aliquam elit leo, aliquet quis mattis eu, ultricies in odio. Sed porttitor, ligula in placerat tempus, tellus nunc accumsan nisi, a laoreet nulla diam sed neque. Praesent felis orci, <span>dignissim</span> non consectetur ac, fermentum id lectus. Duis neque tortor, molestie vel dictum vitae, lacinia nec nisi. Proin ut est eros. Proin commodo est vitae dui scelerisque semper. Integer ut tortor eu nisl interdum aliquet ac sit amet odio. Proin ut neque dolor. In non elementum massa. In non fringilla nibh. Suspendisse a tortor neque.</p>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>

```

##Solution Video
I haven't made this yet, but I plan on making a video where I complete the challenge myself and talk through how I would do it.
