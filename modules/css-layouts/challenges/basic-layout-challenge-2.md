#Basic Layout Challenge 2

**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

This challenge is harder than Basic Layout Challenge 1 because I'm not providing you the HTML. As part of your challenge, you must figure out what HTML elements to use. Note: I am, however, providing you with the Lorem Ipsum text.

Your challenge is laid out for you in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRwon0Jd1Hc), which also shows the solution. The second half of the solution can be found in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEN4pZ2z3T4).

Here is a picture of what the final product should look like (exactly), though you should realize that a photo doesn't tell the whole story. You'll need to watch the first part of the first video to see how the page should adapt as it is resized.
