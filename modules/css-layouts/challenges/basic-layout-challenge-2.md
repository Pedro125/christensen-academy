#Basic Layout Challenge 2

**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

Your challenge is laid out for you in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRwon0Jd1Hc), which also shows the solution. The second half of the solution can be found in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEN4pZ2z3T4).

Here is a picture of what the final product should look like (exactly), though you should realize that a photo doesn't tell the whole story. You'll need to watch the first part of the first video to see how the page should adapt as it is resized.
