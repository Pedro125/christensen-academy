#CSS Positioning Article

Your challenge is to read [this article on positioning](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/css-positioning-101/) and [this article on floating elements](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/css-floats-101/) and write a 1-paragraph reflection on their helpfulness. Did you find them a useful way to learn? What advantages or disadvantages do they have over, say, my Christensen Academy videos? What way do you learn Web design and development best?

**Note:** These are intended to supplement the videos I've made on positioning and floating. Your goal should really be to complete the challenges and thoroughly understand what you did. If the videos help, great. If these articles help, great. If you find another way to learn, great.

**Note:** One of the reasons for this challenge is that being able to understand articles like these is a tremendously helpful skill to have. The Internet is full of articles like these--though not always as good--and if you can understand them, you can learn almost anything.

##Friendly Advice
Take it slow. Read carefully. Examine the examples. Take time to look up stuff you don't understand. Then, experiment, experiment, experiment. If you get stuck or something doesn't make sense, persevere.
