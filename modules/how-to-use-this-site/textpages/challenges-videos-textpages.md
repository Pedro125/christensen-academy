#Challenge Maps, Video Playlists, and Textpages
Welcome to the Christensen Academy! I started this website in June of 2012 for a variety of reasons. Since that time, my vision for it has been constantly evolving. While my initial focus was on creating educational YouTube videos, I've since begun reorganizing everything into learning modules composed of three components: challenge maps, video playlists, and textpages. The purpose of this textpage is to explain how challenge maps, video playlists, and textpages work.

###Student-Paced Learning Modules
I'd like to suggest that the single most important change in education over the next ten years will be a shift away from teacher-paced courses towards student-paced learning modules. I contend that at our traditional model of education, which attempts to move groups of students together at a fixed pace, no longer makes much sense when we could be doing things more efficiently, effectively, affordably, flexibly, and enjoyably in a system built on student-paced learning modules.

In essence, the Christensen Academy is my attempt at building examples of such student-paced learning modules. Sure, these modules can be used as part of a traditional course that attempts to educate a group of students at a uniform, teacher-controlled pace, but that's not really what they're indended for.

**Note:** In my ideal world, I wouldn't be a one-man shop trying to create everything myself. I'd love some help. If you're interested in joining in, please let me know (cameron@christensenacademy.org).

**Note:** It takes me a long time to record videos, write textpages, and design and write challenges. Because of this, many of the modules you currently see on christensenacademy.org are really works in progress. Even the most robust modules to date--the modules on [Web design and development](http://christensenacademy.org/#html-basics)--are in need of further refinement.

###Challenge Maps

Although challenge maps have been the most recent addition to the site, they are undoubtedly the most important. In my view, completing a module is roughly synonymous with completing that module's challenge map.

There is no "right" way to complete the challenge map. My advice to students is simple: follow the arrows. I try hard to scaffold challenges in a logical manner from easy and well-defined challenges near the start of the challenge map to harder and more open-ended projects at the end.

Each challenge generally requires students to *produce* something. As students complete challenges, their work is saved in a portfolio. This portfolio is something students can look back on with pride. It can also be offered up as strong evidence of learning, especially if one or more of the challenges involved an open-ended project that required application of knowledge in new situations.

###Video Playlists

Basically, these are just video lectures I put on YouTube. These video lectures are helpful for people learning something for the first time. They have a few benefits over traditional lectures, such as the abilities to pause and replay.

###Textpages

Textpages provide the same info as the videos, but in written form. I like to think of the textpages I write as small sections of a traditional textbook.

Although I much prefer writing computer code to English prose, I realized that video playlists were not enough. Videos are great for students learning concepts for the first time, but for students that just need a quick refresher on a concept, it's hard to beat written language as a reference tool. What's more, I've also found that some students prefer skipping the videos all together and going straight to the textpages. Reading is simply more efficient.

###Conclusion
The general idea of student-paced modules doesn't need to be constrained to my system of challenge maps, video playlists, and textpages. This is merely the system I've devised based on what I thought would work well. I've also been constrained by the limited resources at my disposal; namely, time and my own teaching abilities.

If you're someone hoping to use this site to learn, I wish you the best of luck! Don't hesitate to send me an email at cameron@christensenacademy.org with questions or suggestions.
