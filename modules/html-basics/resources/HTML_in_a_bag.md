#HTML in a Bag

##Overview

The HTML tags needed to make a basic webpage are written on notecards (of various colors and sizes) and placed in a bag. Text nodes are also placed in the bag.

##Bag Contents

For the initial version of HTML in a Bag, I'm using colored note cards cut into different sizes. On each tag (card), I've written the opening tag (front) and closing tag (back). So, two tags (cards) will be needed to create a "normal" element that has both an opening and closing tag.

##Getting Started

###Elements and Tags

Students need to undertand the basic idea of an HTML element being composed of an opening tag, a closing tag, and some "stuff" in the middle. Tags essentially tell the browser what to do with the "stuff" in the middle.

With this in mind, introducing HTML in a Bag should start with an overview of how to *build* elements with the cards.

###The Basic Structure of a Webpage

It's important to practice creating the basic structure of a webpage at the start. The same elements will be used over and over and over again, but it's important for students to understand that these components.

###Empty (Void) Elements



##Game 1: Speed Coder

Players take turns competing against the clock to build webpages.

This game is won best out of three

Each competition follows these steps:

1. Nerdiest player goes first (i.e., is the coding player first).
2. Non-coding player draws a Code Card (see below) and reads it aloud.
3. Non-coding player says, "One, two, three, code!" and starts the timer.
4. Coding player builds the webpage as quickly as possible.
5. When finished and confident that no errors have been made, the coding player says, "Coding complete!" and the timer is stopped.
6. Non-coding player checks the answer in the answer book. Make sure to pay close attention to detail. Indentation is crucial. Any mistakes result in a forfeit.
7. Players reverse roles and repeat steps 2-6.
