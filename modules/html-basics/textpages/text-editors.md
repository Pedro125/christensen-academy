#Text Editors
Websites can be developed on any computer. All that's required is a simple program called a *text editor* in which to write your code. Unlike a word processing program, text editors only manipulate plain text, which makes them, in comparison to word processors like Microsoft Word, rather simple.

###Suggested Text Editors
Both Windows and Mac come with text editors already installed (Notepad and TextEdit respectively). However, I don't recommend using either of them. Instead, you should download a better one for free.

####Windows
* [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

####Mac
* [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/)
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

####Linux
* [gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/)
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

###Syntax
When writing computer code, the word syntax refers the rules of the language you're working in. In HTML, for example, the syntax for creating an element requires you to have an opening tag, some conent, then a closing tag:
```
<p>This is the content of the paragraph element.</p>
```
####Syntax Highlighting
Most text editors attempt to display code in a colorful fashion that helps you more easily spot errors. The following example is what the basic HTML template might look like in an editor that uses syntax highlighting:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```
