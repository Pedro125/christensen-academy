##Validation
To help you catch errors in your code, you can use the [W3C Validator](http://validator.w3.org/). Make sure to read the error messages and pay attention to the line numbers.

**Note:** Just because the validator shows you 10 errors, doesn't mean there are actually 10 errors. You might actually just have one error, and when you fix that error, the other "errors" may disappear.

**Note:** The error messages from the validator aren't always as helpful as you might hope. Think of the error messages as clues, and realize that you'll still have to do the detective work to actually track down the error itself.
