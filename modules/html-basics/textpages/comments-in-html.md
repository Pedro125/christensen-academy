#HTML Comments
Comments in html are completely ignored by browsers. Developers use them to leave notes to themselves and to other developers.

Comments always start with `<!--` and end with `-->`.

###Examples of Comments
```html
<!-- TODO: Fix broken links -->
<p>
  The best soda is <a href="http://christensenacademy.org/mountaindew.hmlt">Mountain Dew</a>.
</p>
```

###Commenting Out Code
Sometimes you might find it useful to temporarily "comment out" your code. Basically, this just means that you put comments around a portion of your code you want to temporarily not be displayed by the Web browser.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Bananas</li>
  <li>Kiwi</li>
  <li>Strawberry</li>
  <!--
  <li>Blueberry</li>
  <li>Blackberry</li>
  -->
</ul>
```
