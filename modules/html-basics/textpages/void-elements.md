#Void Elements

In English, "void" generally alludes to the idea of nothingness. In the case of HTML, void elements are elements that never have any content and are thus said to be "empty" or "void".

**Important Note:** Because void elements don't have content, void elements don't need closing tags.

###Some Examples of "Empty" (Void) Elements
```html
<hr>                  <!-- Horizontal Rule: Creates a horizontal rule (line) across the page. -->
<br>                  <!-- Break: Creates an extra vertical space on the page. -->
<meta charset="utf-8"><!-- Lest the browser know what type of character encoding is being used -->
<img src="ipsum.png"> <!-- Image: Makes an image appear on the page -->
```
