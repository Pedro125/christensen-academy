#Basic HTML Elements

###Basic Structure of a Webpage
```html
<!-- The DOCTYPE tag lets the browser know which version of HTML you page was written in. -->
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- This is the HTML5 doctype -->

<!-- The html element is the parent element to all other elements on your page. NOTE: It only has 
two direct children (head and body), but these children have many children within them. -->
<html>
  
  <!-- The head element is the parent element to elements that provide extra information about the 
  page but that don't actually display on the page. Examples of such elements include title and meta
  elements -->
  <head>
  
    <!-- The title element displays in the tab of the browser above the webpage. It is also used by 
    search engines to return search results -->
    <title>Example Webpage</title>
  </head>
  
  <!-- The body element contains all of the elements that will display on the page. -->
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```

##Basic HTML Elements

```html
<p>Lorem Ipsum</p>    <!-- The paragraph element is used whenever you want a paragraph of text on your webpage. -->
<h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>  <!-- The h1 element is used whenever you want a very important heading on your page.
                          By default it displays the largest of all of the headings. -->
<h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>  <!-- The h2 element is interpreted to have slightly less importance than an h1 element.
                          By default it displays slightly smaller than an h1. -->
<h3>Lorem Ipsum</h3>
<h4>Lorem Ipsum</h4>
<h5>Lorem Ipsum</h5>
<h6>Lorem Ipsum</h6>  <!-- The h2 element is the least significant (displays smallest) heading element. -->
<ul>                  <!-- Unordered List: Creates a bulleted list. -->
  <li>lorem</li>      <!-- List Item: Creates a list item inside of a list. -->
  <li>ipsum</li>
</ul>
<ol>                  <!-- Ordered List: Creates a numbered list. -->
  <li>lorem</li>
  <li>ipsum</li>
</ol>
```
