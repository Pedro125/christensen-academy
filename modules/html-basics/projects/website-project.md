#Basic Website Project

* **Challenge:** Exercise your creativity to build a unique website using HTML.
* **Estimated Time:** 150 minutes.

##Video Introduction

It's on my to do list to make an intro video for this project so that you can see an example or two.

##Project Ideas

* a school site
* a business site
* a fan site (e.g., I <3 Coldplay)
* a humor site

##Requirements

**Note:** The following requirements are intended to help you flex all of your HTML muscles. Use this project as a way to help you solidify your knowledge and understanding of HTML.

###Required Tags

The first five should be obvious:

* !DOCTYPE
* html
* head
* body
* title

The rest of the elements should be used at least once unless specified otherwise:

* meta
* p
* **headings:** h1, h2, h3, ..., h6 (use at least two different types)
* br
* hr
* **lists:** ol, ul, li (have at least one list
* img (min = 3)

###Other Requirements

* pages (min = 4)
* Links to get from page to page
* html entities (min = 2)
* all pages must validate with zero errors (warnings are okay)

##Rubric

* **Creativity and Uniqueness:** Your website should have unique content (no plagiarism, obviously), and you should seek to structure your pages in interesting ways making use of links, images, lists, and other HTML elements you've learned. Furthermore, you are welcome to research new HTML elements that weren't covered in this module. As a word of caution, however, try to stay away from HTML elements that are used for presentation (visual styling) purposes. For example, you may come across HTML elements that change font properties. Realize that these should be avoided as we'll be learning CSS in the next module, which is the correct way to style webpages. Varoius HTML styling elements are bad remnants of days gone by. There are a few exceptions to this rule, such as the `<em>` and `<strong>` elements, which turn text italic and bold respectively and are still acceptable to use today. But other than that, stay away from all HTML elements that are used for visual styling purposes.
* **Correctness:** Your code should be error free and have flawless indentation. There are some things you shouldn't get "creative" with. Indenting your code is one of them. Allowing errors in your code is another. Use the [HTML validator](http://validator.w3.org/) to help you find your errors.
* **Requirements:** Fulfill all of the requirements listed above.
