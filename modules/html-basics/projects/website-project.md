#Basic Website Project

**Estimated Time:** 135 minutes.

##Project Ideas

* a personal portfolio site--a resume of sorts
* a school site
* a business site
* a fan site (e.g., I <3 Daft Punk)
* a humor site

##Requirements

**Note:** The following requirements are intended to help you flex all of your HTML muscles. Use this project as a way to help you solidify your knowledge and understanding of HTML.

###Required Tags

The first five should be obvious:

* !DOCTYPE
* html
* head
* body
* title

The rest of the elements should be used at least once unless specified otherwise:

* meta
* p
* **headings:** h1, h2, h3, ..., h6 (use at least two different types)
* br
* hr
* **lists:** ol, ul, li (have at least one list
* img (min = 3)

###Other Requirements

* pages (min = 4)
* navigation: there need to be links to get from page to page
* html entities (min = 2)
* all pages must validate with zero errors

##Rubric

* **Creativity and Uniqueness:** Your website should have unique content (no plagiarism, obviously), and you should seek to structure your pages in interesting ways making use of links, images, lists, and other HTML elements you've learned.
* **Research:** You are expected to research and use at least two new HTML elements that were not coered in this module. **A Word of Caution:** Be wary of HTML elements that attempt to add style to your page. Remember, CSS (the next module) will allow you to add style to your webpages. Here are two example of *deprecated* (i.e., you're not supposed to use them anymore) elements: `<center>`, which was for centering text, and `<b>`, which was for making text bold.
* **Correctness:** Your code should be error free and have flawless indentation. There are some things you shouldn't get "creative" with. Indenting your code is one of them. Allowing errors in your code is another. Use the [HTML validator](http://validator.w3.org/) to help you find your errors.
* **Requirements:** Fulfill all of the requirements listed above.
