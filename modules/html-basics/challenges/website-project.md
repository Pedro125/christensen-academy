#Basic Website Project

**Estimated Time:** 120 minutes

##Project Ideas

* a personal portfolio site--a resume of sorts
* a school site
* a business site
* a fan site (e.g., I <3 Daft Punk)
* a humor site

##Requirements
###Required Tags

On every page:

* `!DOCTYPE html`
* `html`
* `head`
* `body`
* `title`
* `meta`

On at least one page:

* `p`
* **headings:** `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, ..., `h6` (use at least two different types)
* `br`
* `hr`
* **a list:** `ol` or `ul`
* `img` (min = 3)

###Other Requirements

* pages (min = 4)
* an image folder to store your images--you should be using relative paths for all of your images
* html entities (min = 2)
* all pages must validate with zero errors

##Rubric

* **Creativity and Uniqueness:** Your website should have unique content (no plagiarism, obviously), and you should seek to structure your pages in interesting ways making use of links, images, lists, and other HTML elements you've learned.
* **Research:** You are expected to research and use at least two new HTML elements that were not coered in this module.
* **Page Navigation:** Your site is easy to navigate, and you've clearly spent a lot of time thinking about how to place links on your pages to make it as easy as possible for people to find their way around your site.
* **Correctness:** Your code should be error free and have flawless indentation. There are some things you shouldn't get "creative" with. Indenting your code is one of them. Allowing errors in your code is another. Use the [HTML validator](http://validator.w3.org/) to help you find your errors.
* **Requirements:** Fulfill all of the requirements listed above.
