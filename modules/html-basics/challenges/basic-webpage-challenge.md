**Hint:** The second and third headings are smaller than the first one.

##Friendly Advice
* Don't type out of those nonsensical words! That would be a monumental waste of time. Instead, do what lots of Web designers do and use [Lorem Ipsum text](http://lipsum.com/feed/html). It's okay if the words are not exactly the same as the ones you see in the example picture.
* Focus on proper code indentation. Get used to doing it right from the very beginning. As you learn more HTML and CSS, this will get more and more important. It's a readability issue. If you don't indent properly, your code will become unreadable. If you're unsure, study examples in the [reference guide](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/blob/master/modules/html-basics/reference.md) to see how children are always indented inside of their parents.
* I suggest coding this challenge completely from scratch just to give yourself some practice. In future challenges, I suggest doing exactly the opposite. In the future, I would copy the starter code for a basic webpage from the [reference guide](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/blob/master/modules/html-basics/reference.md#basic-html-template) unless you really feel like you want to practice writing everything from scratch. In the real world, realize that there's little need to memorize the code because it's so easy to look it up if you get stuck. Personally, I've memorized quite a bit of HTML code, but that's only because I've been using it so long that I eventually memorized it without trying to. Yet, I still often look things up just to double-check and because copy and pasting basic code helps prevent me from accidently mistyping a character or two.
