#Text Editor Challenge

* **Estimated Time:** 25 minutes

Your challenge is to download and install a text editor for writing HTML code, then use it to create a basic webpage.

###Code for Your Webpage

Copy and paste the following HTML code into a new file in your text editor. Then, save it making sure to name it *something.html*. **All webpages you create will need to end in either .html or .htm**. Then, open it in your browser to see it in its full glory!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is my webpage!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

###Really, Really Important Concept to Understand
Many people are very confused about HTML files initially because we don't use them like other files on our computers. Most files we always open with the same program. For example, Microsoft Word files only open in Microsoft Word; you can't, for example, open a Word document (.docx file) in iTunes. But, HTML files are different. HTML files can be opened with two types of programs: text editors and browsers.

The browser is the program that we're used to browsing the World Wide Web (Internet) with. I like to use Google Chrome as my browser, but other people might use browsers like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari. The HTML files (webpages) you create can be opened by any of these browser programs. In fact, when you double-click on an HTML file on your computer, it should (by default) open up in whatever your default browser program is. The job of the browser is to read the HTML code of the HTML file, interpret it, and display it nicely on the screen.

The text editor has a much different job than the browser. Instead of interpreting and displaying the HTML file nicely on the screen, it shows you the actual code so that you can edit it--hence the name text editor. When you edit your code in a text editor, you must save your changes. Then, you can open that very same HTML file in a browser program to see what it actually looks like.

**Note:** By default, your computer probably won't open your HTML files in your text editor, so you'll probably need to right-click on them and choose "open with" to find your text editor. Alternatively, you can use the open option from the toolbar of your text editor, which would also work just fine. If you want to change your computers default behavior when you double-click on a file, you can. For that, I'll let Google be your guide.

Again, the key idea is that whether you're opening your file in a text editor or a browser, **it is the same exact file.** Some people, I think, get confused thinking that they're somehow working with two separate files.
