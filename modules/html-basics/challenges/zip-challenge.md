#Zip Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

##Challenge

Pick a website you've been creating on your computer and zip all of the associated files and folders. Then, send this zip file to a friend and have them open it. Hopefully, if they extract the contents of the zip file, they'll have your website just as it was before you zipped it up.
