#Zip Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

1. Download [this zip file](http://christensenacademy.org/modules/html-basics/challenges/zip-challenge.zip).
2. Extract the contents of the zip file, which is a mini website. Open up the website files in your browser to make sure the links work. If they don't, you didn't extract the zip file correctly.
3. Edit one of the HTML files.
4. Create a new zip file containing the entire modified mini website.
5. Send the new zip file to a friend and have them open it. Hopefully, if they extract the contents of the zip file, they'll have your website just as it was before you zipped it up.
