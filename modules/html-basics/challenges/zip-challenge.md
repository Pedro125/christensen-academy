#Zip Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

###Overview
The big idea behind this challenge is that you (a) practice extracting the contents of zip files and (b) practice creating your own zip files.

###Part 1: Extracting (Unzipping)
1. Download [this zip file](http://christensenacademy.org/modules/html-basics/challenges/zip-challenge.zip).
2. Extract the contents of the zip file, which is a mini website, making sure that it gets saved alongside all of your other challenges for this module.
3. Open up the website files in your browser to make sure the links work. If they don't, you didn't extract the zip file correctly.

###Part 2: Creating a Zip File
1. In your file browser, find all of the challenges you've completed for this module so far--hopefully you have them stored all in the same folder. Select all of the files, then create a zip file named "zip-challenge" that contains all of the files you had selected.
2. Send the new zip file to a friend and have them open it. Hopefully, if they extract the contents of the zip file, they'll have all of the files for your challenges just as they were before you zipped them up.
