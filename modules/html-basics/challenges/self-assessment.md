#Self Assessment: HTML Basics

* **Challenge:** Carefully answer the questions and check your work by watching the solution video.
* **Estimated Time:** 15 minutes.

##The Questions
Answer the following questions to the best of your ability. Then, watch the solution video to see if you were right.

1. Webpages are created...
  * by magic.
  * in much the same way you make things in a word processor like Microsoft Word.
  * with a simple text editor in which you can write HTML code.
  * on special computers that are used only by Web designers and developers.
2. While HTML is plain text used to create the basic content of a webpage, CSS and JavaScript...
  * are also plain text used to create visual styling and add interactivity respectively.
  * have nothing to do with creating webpages.
  * are used to create visual styling and add interactivity respectively but cannot be created with a simple text editor.
  * None of the above.
3. "White space" in HTML files refers to things like tabs, spaces, and returns (newlines) in the code. Circle all true statements.
  * White space can be used to indent child elements inside of their parents. This makes code much easier to read and will help prevent you from making errors later on.
  * Extra white space has absolutely no effect on the way a page is displayed by the browser.
  * Neither of the previous statements are true.
4. What's the purpose of the head and body elements on the webpage?
  * The head element doesn't actually matter and you can do without it. The real elements that make a page are children of the body element.
  * Children of the body element will display visually on the page. Children of the head element really only serve to provide extra information about the webpage. An example of an element that occurs in of the head section (i.e., is a child of the head element) is the title element, which appear in the tab of a web browser, not on the page itself.
  * Children of the head element appear at the top of the webpage, whereas children of the body element appear in the middle of the webpage.
  * None of the above.
5. Give an example of an HTML comment.
6. What's the difference between the terms "HTML tag" and "HTML element"? Include an explanation of opening and closing tags as part of your answer.
7. Explain how HTML lists work making sure to use the following vocabulary: element, opening tag, closing tag, parent, child.
8. Explain why we have h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements but only one p element.
