#Relative Path Challenge

**Warning**: I haven't finished making this challenge yet.

* **Challenge:** Make all of the images and links work for the Joersz Academy, the arch rival of the Christensen Academy.
* **Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

###Getting Started
1. Download the [zip file](http://christensenacademy.org/modules/html-basics/challenges/relative-path-challenge.zip) that contains all of the files and folders for the Joersz Academy.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file and save them a new location. I recommend simply saving them to a new folder named "relative-path-challenge".
3. Examine the source of *each and every* HTML file. Figure out how to make all of the images and links work by specifying correct relative paths (no absolute paths allowed). I've left comments in the HTML to clarify where each of the paths should go to.

###Friendly Advice

* Make sure to use the `href` attribute for anchor elements and the `src` attribute for image elements when specifying paths.
* Remember that when specifying paths, `../` means "go up a folder" and `img/` means go into, in this case, the "img" folder.
