#Keyboard Shortcuts Challenge

* **Challenge:** Try out each of [the shortcuts listed on the reference guide](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/blob/master/modules/html-basics/reference.md#useful-keyboard-shortcuts). Figure out which ones you find useful.
* **Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

I hope you find this challenge helpful. Good luck! You'll be doing a lot of coding in the challenges to come. If you don't remember these after this challenge, no worries! Just come back and check them out whenever you want to get a little faster at developing webpages.

**Philosophical Musing:** Besides being kind of fun, the real benefit of getting comfortable with some of these shortcuts, I think, is that they free your mind up to focus on the real problem solving. If it takes you a while to think through and execute a simple copy and paste, for example, your brain is prevented from thinking about the larger goal of what you're trying to accomplish.

If using Mac, replace ctrl (control) with the command key. If that still doesn't work, a quick Google search should supply the answer.
```
ctrl + s = save
ctrl + a = highlight all
ctrl + x = cut
ctrl + c = copy
ctrl + v = paste
ctrl + z = undo
ctrl + y = redo
ctrl + f = find
ctrl + h = replace (in Notepad++)
tab = indent selection
shift + tab = unindent selection
ctrl + scroll wheel = grow/shrink text size
ctrl + r = refresh browser
ctrl + d = duplicate (only in Notepad++)
ctrl + alt + shift + r = open in browser (only in Notepad++)
alt + tab = switch windows (command + tab on Mac)
shift + arrows = highlight
shift + ctrl + arrows = turbo highlight (shift + option + arrows on Mac)
```
