I hope you find this challenge helpful. Good luck! You'll be doing a lot of coding in the challenges to come. If you don't remember these after this challenge, no worries! Just come back and check them out whenever you want to get a little faster at developing webpages.

**Philosophical Musing:** Besides being kind of fun, the real benefit of getting comfortable with some of these shortcuts, I think, is that they free your mind up to focus on the real problem solving. If it takes you a while to think through and execute a simple copy and paste, for example, your brain is prevented from thinking about the larger goal of what you're trying to accomplish.
