#Intro to HTML Basics Module

The purpose of this module is to help people learn the basics of writing HTML code. The focus is on conceptual understanding as opposed to memorizing all of the HTML elements known to man.

Notably, this module completely ignores HTML forms and tables.

##Challenges
Throughout the module, you will see links to various challenges. Of course, you should be practicing along with each of the videos and creating your own little challenges for yourself as you go. These challenges, however, are ones I thought were particularly important for people trying to learn HTML.

##Projects
There is only one project in this module, and it is to make a basic HTML website. The project is reasonably open-ended, so hopefully you enjoy experimenting with what's possible in HTML.

##Assessment
If you're in my class, assessment at the end of the module will take the form of a test that's part written and part on the computer.
