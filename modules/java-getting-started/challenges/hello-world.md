###Challenge
Your challenge is to successfully write, compile, and run your first program in Java. You may use whatever IDE you like, and I encourage you to experiment and play around with multiple of them if you have time. I've created videos for each of the IDEs to help you on this challenge.

Good luck! If for some reason you run into technical difficulties on this challenge, don't give up! I hope to see you in the next module where we start learning more about how Java programming actually works.
