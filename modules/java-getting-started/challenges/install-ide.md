* **Estimated Time:** 10 minutes (if all goes well)

##Challenge
Install and run an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for writing Java Programs. I recommend choosing one of the following, all of which are free:

* **Dr. Java** (for simplicity)
* **BlueJ** (for a more visual system that helps you see the connections between your files)
* **NetBeans** (for a more professional, full-featured IDE). NOTE: I'll be using this in my tutorials.
* **Eclipse** (for another professional, full-featured IDE that is a bit more complex, in my opinion, than NetBeans).

Once you have the IDE installed, you should be ready for the next challenge.
