#JDK vs. JRE
The JDK (Java Development Kit) is what you need if you want to start developing Java programs. With that said, I think most IDEs come with the JDK, so you shouldn't need to install it separately. If you do need to install the JDK separately, it's not that hard. Just search for "JDK" and you should find it immediately. There will be a couple of different versions. Unless you have a good reason for doing otherwise, you should probably go with the SE (Standard Edition) version.

**Note:** For whatever reason, Oracle always puts the JRE download right next to the JDK download in some bizarre attempt to introduce confusion into what otherwise should be a simple matter of installing the JDK.

Realize that the JRE is the Java Runtime environment, which you probably already had on your computer in the first place. Also, the JDK comes with the JRE if you didn't have it already, so there's really no reason you'd ever need to download just the JRE.

Once you have the JDK installed, your IDE should recognize it immediately. If not, you'll need to do some troubleshooting.
