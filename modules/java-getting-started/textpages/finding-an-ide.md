#Finding a Java IDE
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) are used by programmers to... well, program. This post briefly describes what IDEs do and provides an overview of four different IDEs you might want to consider if you're going to be writing Java programs.

##Text Editors vs. IDEs
All programs are written in plain text. While most programmers write code in IDEs, it's entirely possible to write all of your programs in simple text editors.

If you've never programmed before, you may have never used a text editor before. You can think of a text editor as being similar to a word processor like Microsoft Word but without any of the formatting controls. For example, it makes no sense to adjust margins, change the font of text, or add pictures to a plain text document, thus text editors can't do these types of things. All they do is let you write and edit plain ol' text.

Right now, I am typing this document using a text editor called Notepad++. I use this text editor quite a bit for things like writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

There are a lot of text editors out there. On Windows, the default text editor is Notepad, on Mac the default is TextEdit, and on Linux the default is gedit. Of course, there are plenty of other options out there, many of which are free.

I could also use my text editor to write Java programs, but I don't usually do that. I prefer using an IDE, which offers me some special features that make my life as a Java programmer easier.

So what exactly do IDEs offer that simple text editors don't? Here's a brief list:

* Built-in compiling features so you don't have to use the command line.
* Syntax highlighting, which helps you spot errors in your code
* Code completion, giving you suggestions so you don't have to go look things up
* Debugging tools, which help you track down tricky bugs in your code
* Tools for managing projects


There are a lot of IDE's out there. For Java programming, the two most popular are NetBeans and Eclipse. Just remember, all Java programs could be written in a simple text editor, but most developers prefer to use IDEs.

##Four Java IDEs
The following IDEs are all free. To the best of my knowledge, there aren't any compelling paid-for options.

Instead of telling you which one I think works best, I encourage you to experiment with more than one of them and figure out which one you like best. To get you started, however, here are some general things to keep in mind about each IDE:

###NetBeans
* Developed by Oracle who maintains Java itself
* Professional, full-featured IDE
* Arguably less complex than Eclipse, which is a similar IDE
* More features than a beginner might want. This can be confusing initially.

###Eclipse
* Perhaps the most popular Java IDE
* Professional, full-featured IDE like NetBeans
* Arguably more complex than NetBeans
* More features than a beginner might want. This can be confusing initially.

###Dr Java
* Built for beginners
* Not full-featured like Eclipse and NetBeans. It even lacks more standard features like basic code completion.
* Very straightforward and simple. No surprises.

###BlueJ
* Built for beginners
* Not full-featured like Eclipse and NetBeans.
* Tries to be very visual to highlight Java's object-oriented nature. This may be a helpful teaching and learning tool. Honestly, I feel like I should look into BlueJ more than I have. I personally use * NetBeans or Eclipse.
