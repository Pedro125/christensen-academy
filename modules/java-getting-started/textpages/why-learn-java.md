#Why Learn Java?
This is a complex question. The following answer is aimed at helping someone new to programming figure out if they should spend their time learning the Java programming language. These are really just my personal thoughts on the matter. If you have something else to add or disagree with one of my points, please leave a comment below the post.

##Why You Might Want to Learn Java
* **Popularity:** Lots of other people use it, so its a good thing to know. It's also the main language used in Computer Science programs around the world, at least from what I can tell. Also, many newer languages have been designed to look similar to Java. So, once you know Java, you'll likely have an easier time learning other languages later.
* **Strongly-typed:** Without actually defining what "strongly-typed" means, I'd just like to say that I appreciate how Java forces programmers to be very explicit in the code they write. I think this is valuable for new programmers.
* **Garbage Collection:** This is a feature of Java that allows programmers to not worry about deleting unused objects from memory. This makes programming simpler than it was in traditional programming languages like C++.

##Why You Might Want to Learn Another Language
* **Verbosity:** Partly because they're strongly typed, Java programs tend to be significantly more verbose than other languages; that is, as a Java programmer, you'll probably find yourself writing more code than you would working in another language.
* **Cool Factor:** Java isn't all that exciting. Other languages, such as the Processing language, allow new programmers to work in a more visual environment. Most people tend to like this sort of thing. 

##Conclusion
You really can't go wrong trying to learn Java. It's not my favorite language to program in, but it's definitely valuable to learn.
