#Hello World: Your First Java Program
The code for your first program will be the same regardless of which IDE you're using. With that said, details of actually using an IDE can be tricky. Because of this, I've created four videos for writing the HelloWorld program, one for each different IDE, so hopefully you can get one of them to work.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

**Important:** This code must be saved in a file named HelloWorld.java, which must exactly match the name of the class in the first line of the program `public class HelloWorld {`.

Please realize that understading all the parts of this first program is actually quite difficult. You'll learn more and more as you go. For now, I'd focus on the center line: `System.out.println("Hello, World");`. The first part `System.out.println` is telling the computer to print out a message. The `("Hello World")` part is specifying what message should be printed out.

When you run the program in your IDE, you should see the message "Hello World" displayed somewhere in an output panel of some sort.

Good luck!
