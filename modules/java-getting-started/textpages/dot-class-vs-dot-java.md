#.class vs .java
When you write your code, you'll save it as a .java file. For example, your first program was saved as HelloWorld.java. When you compile your code--which is something some IDEs like NetBeans and Eclipse do automatically--a .class file will be created. In this case, a file named HelloWorld.class was created. The .class file is the Java bytecode and is the actual program that runs in the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) on your computer. After the .class file is created, you could delete the .java file, and your program would still work. You wouldn't want to do this, however, because then you could never edit and recompile your program again.
