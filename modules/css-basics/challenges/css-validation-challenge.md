#CSS Validation Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

**Prerequisite Knowledge:**

* How to use the [CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
* Basic syntax for writing CSS rules.

**Your challenge is to fix all of the errors in the CSS (below).**

You can get started by copying that CSS into a new CSS file *(validate.css)*. Once you've saved your file, you should start fixing the errors you see in the CSS. To be completely sure you've fixed all of the errors, you must use the [CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). If the validator tells you that errors still exist in your CSS, you must fix them.

###CSS
```css
h1 {
  background;red:color:black;
}

h2 }
  colour:red;
}

body 
{
  back-ground:        grey;
  color: white;
{

p {background: blue;}
```

##Portfolio

Make sure you save your fixed-up file in your `css-basics` folder. Make sure to name it `validate.css`.
