#Color Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 25 minutes

Your challenge is to create two webpages that look like the following pictures while using **as little CSS as possible**:

**Note:** Using as little CSS as possible means that you'll have to be smart about how you choose class and id names for your elements. It also means you should think carefully about which type of CSS you should use. Hint: USE EXTERNAL CSS!!!

##Helpful Things to Think About
* Both pages use some of the same styles. This is the perfect opportunity to use the same external CSS file with both HTML files!
* On one page there are a lot of paragraphs. On the other page there are a lot of list items. How is it possible to style HTML elements individually or in groups using external CSS (Hint: think class and id attributes).
* Creating exact colors in CSS can be difficult. I recommend finding colors using an online tool like Color Scheme Designer.
  * Of, if you'd like to discover another useful tool, you might try searching for a "color picker" or "eyedropper" tool to install for your browser or your computer.
