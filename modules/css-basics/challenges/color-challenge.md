#Color Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 25 minutes

Your challenge is to create two webpages that look like the following pictures making sure to use **as little CSS as possible**.

**Note:** Using as little CSS as possible means that you'll have to be smart about how you choose class and id names for your elements. It also means you should think carefully about which type of CSS you should use. Hint: USE THE SAME EXTERNAL CSS FILE FOR BOTH PAGES!!!
