#Text and Font Properties Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

**Prerequisite Knowledge:**

* Basic text properties and values
* Basic font properties and values

Your challenge is to create a webpage that demonstrates the use of at least 8 **unique** text and font properties. Reusing the same property but with a different value does not count towards completing this challenge. For example, writing `color:orage` and `color:red` are two CSS declarations that use the same property but different values. **YOU NEED EXAMPLES OF 8 UNIQUE TEXT AND FONT PROPERTIES.**

**Note:** You may use whatever type of CSS you'd like.

##Portfolio

Whatever files you create to complete this challenge, just make sure they're named clearly and that they are in the `css-basics` folder.
