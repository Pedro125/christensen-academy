#Pixel-Percent-EM Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes, assuming you already know how `px`, `em`, and `%` work.

Your challenge is to create a webpage that you can use as proof that you know how `px`, `em`, and `%` are used for changing font sizes with CSS. Also, your webpage should demonstrate that you know how inheritance works in CSS.

If this seems strange, think about it this way: imagine you are applying for a job as a Web designer, and that in your interview you are asked to create a webpage demonstrating your knowledge of how `px`, `em`, and `%` work. What would you do to prove to your potential employer that you know your stuff?

**Note:** You may complete this challenge using whatever type of CSS you'd like.

##Portfolio

Whatever you create, just make sure it's clearly named and in the `css-basics` folder.
