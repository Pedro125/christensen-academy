#Pixel-Percent-EM Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

**Prerequisite Knowledge:**

* The `font-size` property
* The differences between `%`, `px`, and `em` units
* Inheritance

Your challenge is to create a webpage that you can use as proof that you know how `px`, `em`, and `%` are used for changing font sizes with CSS.

Also, your webpage should demonstrate that you know how inheritance works in CSS. For example, how does changing the font-size of the body element affect the rest of the elements on the page? Does it affect all of the elements or just some of them?

**Note:** You may complete this challenge using whatever type of CSS you'd like.

##Portfolio

Whatever you create, just make sure your file or files are clearly named and in the `css-basics` folder.
