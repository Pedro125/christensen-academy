#CSS Site Remodelling Project

Your goal is to remodel a pure HTML website you've already created using CSS.

##Rubric

* **Color Theme:** Your site needs a strong, consistant color theme that contributes to a professoinal look and feel.
* **Research:** You are expected to research and use at least two new css properties that were not coered in this module.
* **Page Navigation:** The hyperlinks of your site need to have custom styles. Use pseudoclasses to to create hover effects and custom active and visited style.
* **100% External CSS:** You must use a single stylesheet for your entire site, which must be at least four pages.
* **Use `class` and `id` Attributes:** Your site should make intelligent use of `class` and `id` attributes.
* **Required Properties:**
  * color
  * background-color
  * font-size
  * font-family
  * font-weight
  * font-style
  * text-align
  * text-indent
  * letter-spacing
  * line-height
* **Code Quality:**
  * Perfect indentation
  * Error free
* **Images:** Images must be stored in a separate image folder. `src` attributes should have relative paths to image files as opposed to using absolute paths, such as URLs to someone else's site online.

##Portfolio
Make sure you create a new folder specifically for this website and put it in the `css-basics` folder.
