#CSS Basics Reference Guide
##Overview
CSS is used to add style to HTML. A key idea for Web developers to understand is that content (HTML) and style (CSS) should be as separate as possible. [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) is a great example of this principle. Each CSS Zen Garden page has the *exact same HTML*. The difference between the HTML documents is one line of code: a link to an external CSS file.

In this module, you will learn the basics of CSS for controlling the visual aspects of your webpages.

##Three Types of CSS
There are three different ways of writing CSS code for a webpage: inline, embedded (also called internal), and external. External CSS is the best because a single CSS file can be used to provide styles to multiple webpages. This has two **huge** benefits:
* Site Maintenance: Change a few lines of code in your CSS and watch as your entire site automatically reflects those changes. Compare this to editing styles for each individual page--or worse, for every element on every page.
* HTML Readability: Remember, your HTML should only hold the content of the page, nothing more. This keeps the HTML simple, neat, and readable.

Inline CSS doesn't have either of these benefits.
