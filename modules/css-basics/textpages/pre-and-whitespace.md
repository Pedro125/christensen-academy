#Pre Element and Whitepace
Use the `pre` element if you'd like your text to not ignore whitespace. "Pre" stands for "preformatted text."
```html
<pre>
The     spaces
      in      this text
      
      
      will be preserved
 when it is displayed
 
 
 on the webpage. This can be useful at times, so give it a try!
</pre>
```

You can tell any element to be formatted this way by using CSS:
```css
white-space:pre;
```
