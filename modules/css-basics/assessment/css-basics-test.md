#CSS Basics Test
I plan on splitting this module in two for the next time, so this document describes what the final assessment might look like for each module individually.

##CSS Basics Module
The emphasis is on conceptual understanding and fluency writing all three types of CSS. Memorization of properties is not the goal. Being able to analyze how CSS works is the goal.

###Written Portion
This will be good for making sure that you know the basic terminology and can write basic CSS code. 

###Computer Portion
The goal of this portion is to check for student fluency in using CSS. The basic format will be mimicry of an existing webpage.

##CSS Layouts Module
The written portion of this test can check for understanding of the box model, the different types of positioning, and strategies for creating layouts. The computer portion will again take the form of mimicry (i.e., recreate an example).

Note: This test may take multiple class periods.
