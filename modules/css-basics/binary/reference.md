#Binary Reference

Binary is a system based on 1s and 0s. Computer work on the binary system.

* Everything a computer **does** involves 1s and 0s.
  * CPUs carry out instructions that are written in 1s and 0s.
  * Messages sent across the Internet are composed entirely of 1s and 0s.

* Everything a computer **stores** is in 1s and 0s.

##Basic Binary Numbers

The decimal number system (also called the base ten number system) represents numbers using ten digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. We use the decimal number system in our everyday lives when dealing with money, doing math, keeping score games, and so on.

In contrast, the binary number system (also called the base two number system) represents numbers using just two digits: 0 1. This is the number system that computer use. You can think of a 1s and 0s in a computer as being "on" and "off" respectively. Alternatively, you can think of 1s as high voltages and 0s as low voltages. Either way, there are only two values: 1 and 0.

**Key Idea:** If we're clever enough, we can represent numbers and do math using just 1s and 0s. This, in fact, is how computers actually do math. Remember, the term "computer" literally means something that computers. When computers were invented, there were primarily invented to do math, but instead of using ten digits, they used just two.
