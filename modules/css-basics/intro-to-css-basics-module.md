#Intro to CSS Basics Module

In this module, you will learn how to write CSS code to style your webpages. The first part of the module will help you learn how to manipulate the colors and text properties of the elements on your webpage. The second part of the playlist will help you learn about the CSS box model and how to create CSS layouts.

This is not a particularly easy module. I think you'll be most successful if you adopt the following strategies:

1. Test yourself. When you think you understand a concept, write code and test it out. If it works, great, but don't stop there. Play around with it until it doesn't work anymore and see if you can learn something in the process.
2. Play. Don't take things too seriously. Let your natural curoiusity run wild. 
3. Don't rush. If you go to fast and move on without fully understanding concepts, you'll run into trouble, guaranteed. Strive for quality, not speed.

#Demonstrating Mastery
Demonstrating mastery on this module will require you to thoroughly complete and understand all of the challenges and projects with a high level of skill and attention to detail.

The goal is not to memorize the various CSS properties and what they do. Instead, your focus should be on developing a deep conceptual understanding of CSS and strive to improve your reseach skills so that you can look things up quickly when you need to.

With regards to the project at the end of the module, your focus should be on creativity. Anyone can follow a formula. Your goal should be to take your newly aquired skills and do something unique with them. By exercising your creativity in this way, you will demonstrate that you have truly mastered basic CSS.
