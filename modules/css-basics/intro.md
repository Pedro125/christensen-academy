#Intro to CSS Basics Module

In this module, you will learn how to write basic CSS code to style your webpages. While CSS can be used to do more advanced things, such as create page layouts, this module focuses on using the basics of CSS to manipulate colors and text properties.

Additionally, a major focus of this module is to help you understand the three major types of CSS.

##Demonstrating Mastery
Step 1: Produce "A"-quality work on the challenges and the project.
Step 2: Perform at an "A" level on the exam.

##Self Check
By the end of the module, you should feel fluent using each of the three types of CSS. If you needed to create a website that looked a certain way in terms of colors, fonts, and other text properties, you'd feel comfortable getting the job done and doing it well.

Note: Mastery of basic CSS doesn't require you to memorize tons of properties and values. What's more important is that you become skilled at researching effectively and efficiently.
