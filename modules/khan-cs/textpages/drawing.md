####Cameron Christensen (2012)

In August 2012, the Khan Academy launched its revolutionary computer science learning platform. I call it revolutionary for a few reasons:

1. No other platform...
2. No other platform...
3. No other platform...

##Christensen Academy vs. Khan Academy CS
(unfinished)

##Getting Started
After you've made an account on the Khan Academy, you can go to [http://www.khanacademy.org/cs](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs) and get started! I recommend going to "[All Tutorials](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs/tutorials/all-tutorials)" and following things in order there.

##Learning Goals
You want to get comforable being able to create rectangles, triangles, ellipses, and lines. You also want to get comforatble changing colors of strokes and fills as well as using the `noStroke` function.

**Note:** There's little need to memorize anything as you'll always have access to the documentation on the Khan Academy which explains how the various functions work and gives you code examples.
