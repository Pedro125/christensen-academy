#Playback Controls Challenge

Your challenge is to create an animation with playback controls (play, pause, and rewind). In addition, your animation needs playback controls for an animated movie clip symbol that is part of one of the symbols in the scene.

**Key Idea:** You'll need to write small bits of ActionScript code to tell the computer what to do when the user clicks on a button.
