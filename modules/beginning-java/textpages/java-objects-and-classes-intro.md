#Java Objects and Classes Intro

Java is an "object oriented" programming language. Fully understanding what this means will take a long time, but hopefully you will find this brief introduction helpful.

##Objects: State and Behavior (Variables and Methods)
In Java (and other object-oriented languages) programmers are constantly working with *objects.* You can think of objects in Java much like you think about the objects you see in your everyday life.

I'm currently looking at a pair of headphones and stapler on the desk next to my computer. As I examine these objects, I notice things about them, such as their size, color, and position on the desk. In a sense, these properties can be thought of as the **state** of these objects. Over time, the state of a given object may change. For example, the stapler may run out of staples or move positions on my desk.

In Java, the state of an object is stored in **variables**, which may change or "vary" while a program runs.

Interestingly, many objects in the real world also *do* things. In the case of my stapler, it can staple papers. In the case of my headphones, they can produce sound. In a sense, these objects have **behavior**.

In Java, each object has clearly-defined modes or **methods** of behavior.

Thus, each object in Java is composed of two parts: state (variables) and behavior (methods).

##Classes

In a sense, a class is a mold from which objects are created. Another way of saying this is that each object is an "instance" of a class.

##Primitive Data Types
While objects and classes are at the heart of the Java language, it is nearly impossible to study them in more depth without first developing an understanding of primitive data types. Primitive data types are used to store basic numerical and text data. Often, the state of an object is little more than a collection of "primitive" data.

##Conclusion

If you're new to learning Java, I encourage you to place your initial focus on learning about primitive data types and basic program logic before worrying much about classes and objects.
