#Boolean Expressions

Boolean values are either `true` or `false`. The term "boolean" was chosen to honor the mathematician [George Boole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole) who essentially developed what is now referred to as boolean logic, which is really the foundation of how computers work. In programming, you will find yourself using lots of boolean logic.

Although they are simple, booleans are essential for adding logic to our programs. Eventually, we will use boolean expressions to make our programs do interesting things. For this textpage, however, the focus is simply on explaining how to write and evaluate boolean expressions.
