#Java API
##What is an API?
The term API (Application Programming Interface) is used whenever a programming language interfaces with another piece of software. In the case of Java, programs must interface with the JRE (Java Runtime Environment); hence, there is a Java API that allows Java programs to interact with the JRE.

Something similar is true for all interpreted languages. In the case Python, programs must interface with the Python interpreter; hence, there is a Python API. In the case of JavaScript, programs must interface with webpages; hence, there is a DOM API.

APIs are very common in the programming world. Anytime software interacts with other software, you'll see an API. Well-designed APIs tend to make programming easier and more productive. There are some really interesting examples of "public APIs" on the Internet, such as the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/getting_started#data_api)

##Java API
If you're new to the Java language and you're confused about why everyone is always talking about the Java API, just realize that most of the code you write in Java will be in some way using the Java API. You'll get familiar with certain parts of the API as you start programming.

If you're interested, you can see the entire [API specification for Java 7](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/)

###Versions of Java
New versions of the Java platform (the JRE including the JVM) continue to be released. Each time this happens the Java API changes accordingly. For example, when Java 5.0 (or 1.5.0 as it is sometimes called) was released, the Scanner class, which I'll be using extensively for teaching purposes, was first included in the Java API. With that said, most of the core classes used in Java haven't changed much if at all in recent history.

If you're wondering about the difference between Java SE, EE, FX, and ME, I'll let you do some Google searching on it. Just realize that I'll be teaching using SE (Standard Edition), though I highly doubt anything I teach wouldn't also work on another version. Except for ME, the other versions just add extra "stuff" to the Java API.
