#Double

In Java, the primitive data type `double` is used to store floating point values, which are essentially all of the numbers that aren't integers, such as 3.4 and -45.298.

A `double` stores a 64-bit floating point number. A `float` stores a 32-bit floating point number. The standard convention is to use `double` instead of `float` unless you have a good reason for doing otherwise. The basic difference between `double` and `float` is that a `double` can (a) hold larger numbers and (b) maintain greater precision.
