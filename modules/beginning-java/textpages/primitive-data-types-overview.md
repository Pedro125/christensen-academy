#Primitive Data Types Overview

While Java is an object-oriented programming language, there are still some things in it that have nothing to do with objects; namely, Java has *primitive data types*, which some people refer to simply as *primitives*.

Primitive data types are used to store integers, floating point numbers, booleans, and characters. If you'd like a more detailed discussion of these concepts, or if you have never heard of integers, floating point numbers, booleans, and characters before, please visit the [binary module](http://christensenacademy.org#binary).

It's important to realize that these primitive data types only serve the purpose of storing simple data. Unlike objects, they do not have **state** and **behavior**. Primitives certainly can't *do* anything, and the only "state" they maintain is the single value they hold, which is either an integer, floating point number, character, or boolean value.
