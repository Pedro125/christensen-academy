#Primitive Data Types Overview

Although Java is an object-oriented programming language, not all variables in the language are objects. In particular, Java has *primitive data types*, which some people refer to simply as *primitives*.

Primitive data types are used to store integers, floating point numbers, booleans, and characters. If you'd like a more detailed discussion of these concepts, or if you have never heard of integers, floating point numbers, booleans, and characters before, please visit the [binary module](http://christensenacademy.org#binary).

###No State or Behavior
It's important to realize that these primitive data types only serve the purpose of storing simple data. Unlike objects, they do not have **state** or **behavior**. Primitives certainly can't *do* anything, and the only data they keep track of is the single value they hold, which is either an integer, floating point number, character, or boolean value.

##Literals
Every primitive type has a "literal" representation of values of that type.

* Integer literals look like `0`, `-8`, `12452`, and so on.
* Floating point literals look like `2.34`, `-8.8883`, and so on.
* Character literals look like `'a'`, '`b'`, `'c'`, `'1'`, `'2'`, `'3'`, `'!'`
* Boolean literals are either `true` or `false`

Interestingly, the only object (i.e., non-primitive data type) that also has a literal representation is a String, which is just a sequence of characters inside of double quotes: `"This is a string!!!"`.

Every language uses literals of some kind. Here's a [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_(computer_programming)) with more info if you're interested.
