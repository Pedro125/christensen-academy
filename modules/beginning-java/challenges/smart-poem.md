#Smart Poem Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

Your challenge is to write a program that prompts the user to enter a word that rhymes with a word of your choosing. The program should store the response then print out a poem using that word to complete a rhyme.

###Example
The program prompts the user `Please enter a word that rhymes with "blue"`.

The user enters `glue`

The program outputs

```
Roses are red
Violets are blue
You pick your nose
And I eat glue
```
