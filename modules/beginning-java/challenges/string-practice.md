#String Practice

**Estimated Time:** 60 minutes, assuming you already have some familiarity working with Strings.

Your challenge is to create a login on [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com) then solve the following problems:

* [helloName](http://codingbat.com/prob/p171896)
* [makeAbba](http://codingbat.com/prob/p161056)
* [makeTags](http://codingbat.com/prob/p147483)
* [makeOutWord](http://codingbat.com/prob/p184030)
* [extraEnd](http://codingbat.com/prob/p108853)
* [firstTwo](http://codingbat.com/prob/p163411)
* [firstHalf](http://codingbat.com/prob/p172267)

##Portfolio
Because you are not actually creating a .java file in this challenge, you should create a `logic-practice.txt` file in same folder that you've been using to store the rest of your files for this module. In the `logic-practice.txt` file, you should simply take some notes on your experience. Try to highlight what you struggled with and what you learned. Obviously, the more detail you provide, the more this enhances your portfolio.
