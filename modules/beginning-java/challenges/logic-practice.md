#Logic Practice Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 90 minutes, assuming you already have some familiarity with using boolean logic and writing methods.

Your challenge is to create a login on [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com) then solve the following problems:

**Note:** The first few problems have solutions available. I encourage you to attempt the problem before looking at the solution. Only use the solution if you absolutely have to.

##Portfolio
Because you are not actually creating a .java file in this challenge, you should create a `logic-practice.txt` file in same folder that you've been using to store the rest of your files for this module. In the `logic-practice.txt` file, you should simply take some notes on your experience. Try to highlight what you struggled with and what you learned. Obviously, the more detail you provide, the more this enhances your portfolio.
