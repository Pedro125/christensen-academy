#Project Euler Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes, assuming you already have some experience working with boolean logic and while loops.

Your challenge is to complete problem 1 on [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).

This is one of my all-time favorite websites. As of 18.2.2013, I have solved 70 problems.

##Portfolio
Create a file named `EulerProblem1.java` and save it in the same folder as the rest of your files for this module.
