#Math Class Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 40 minutes, assuming you already have some familiarity with using Java's Math class.

Your challenge is to create a program called `MathClass.java` that does the following things:

1. Generates and prints out a random **double** between 0 and 1.
2. Generates and prints out a random **double** between 0 and 10.
3. Generates and prints out a random **integer** between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
4. Generates and prints out a random **integer** between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
5. Generates and prints out a random **integer** between 40 and 50 (inclusive). Be careful, this is trickier than you might expect.
5. Generates and prints out a random **double** between -20 and 20.
6. Takes two integers as input from the user and prints out the absolute value of their difference.
7. Takes two doubles as input from the user and prints out the ceiling of their sum.
8. Takes two doubles as input from the user and prints out the floor of their sum.
9. Takes two doubles as input from the user and prints out their sum rounded to the nearest integer.
10. Takes two doubles as input from the user and prints out the bigger value.
11. Takes two doubles as input from the user and prints out the smaller value.
12. Use one other method of Java's [Math](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html) class. You may choose what method you use.
