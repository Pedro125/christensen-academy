#Alien Invasion

**Estimated Time:** 200 minutes

Your challenge is to create the Alien Invasion game. This game is modeled on the [Martian Dice](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/99875/martian-dice) game.

###Overview
You and your fellow aliens are swooping down on Earth in your spaceships in an attemp to collect specimens of chickens, cows, and humans for your alien research. Each time you swoop down upon the planet, tanks may come to the planet's defense. In order for your invasion to be successful, you must overpower the tanks with your spaceships in addition to collecting specimens of chickens, cows, and humans. The more chickens, cows, and humans you collect, the more points you will score. Also, you will receive a bonus if you manage to collect all three types of specimens.

###How the Game Works
You start the game with 13 dice. You attack the planet in rounds, which continue until you're out of dice.

In each round, you do the following:

1. Roll all of the remaining dice. For each die, there is a 1/6th chance of rolling a tank, chicken, cow, or human, and a 2/6th chance of rolling a spaceship.
2. Immediately set all of the tank dice you rolled off to the side, adding them to the total number of tanks defending Earth.
3. Count up the number of chickens, cows, humans, spaceships you've rolled.
4. Choose where to focus your energy this round (i.e., choose whether you want to select spaceships, chickens, cows, or humans). **Note** Whatever dice you select will be set aside thereby decreasing your number of remaining dice.
  * **Collect All Chickens:** You may only do this if you have never collected chickens before and there are actually some chickens available to collect.
  * **Collect All Cows:** You may only do this if you have never collected cows before and there are actually some cows available to collect.
  * **Collect All Chickens:** You may only do this if you have never collected chickens before and there are actually some chickens available to collect.
  * **Select All Spaceships to Battle Tanks:** You may do this only if there are new spaceships ready for battle.
5. If you unable to collect new specimens or assign spaceships to battle, or if you are simply out of dice, the game is over. Otherwise, continue a new round with the remaining dice.

If the number or spaceships was greater than or equal to the number of tanks, your invasion was successful. You score one point for each specimen collected and an additional three points if all three types of specimens were collected.

##Rubric
* **Correct:** The game works as intended and is free of logic errors.
* **Robust:** The game works in all circumstances, even if the user inputs "bad" values.
* **Polished:** The user interface is as nice as possible. The game is intuitive and easy to play.
