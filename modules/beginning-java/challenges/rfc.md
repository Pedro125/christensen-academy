#Poem Challenge

* **Estimated Time:** 10 minutes

Your challenge is to write a program that prints out the following poem to the terminal:

```
Roses are red
Violets are blue
I like binary
And I love 1110101
```

**Note:** What matters here is that the formatting is the same. Make sure the poem prints out line by line as shown here.
