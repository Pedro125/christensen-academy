#Debugging Challenge 1

**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes

Your challenge is to fix all of the syntax errors in the following code. Write comments in the code explaining each error you fixed. Make sure to actually run the program. The output of the program should be `Foo plus Bar = 7`.

```java
public Class debuggingChallenge1 {
  public static void Main(String args) {;
    foo = 4
    int bar;
    3 = bar;
    System.out.println( "Foo plus Bar = " foo + bar );
}
```
