#Debugging Challenge 1

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes, assuming you already have a basic understanding of Java Syntax.

Your challenge is to fix all 8 of the syntax errors in the following code. Write comments in the code explaining each error you fixed. Make sure to actually run the program. The output of the program should be `Foo plus Bar = 7`.

```java
public Class debuggingChallenge1 {
  public static void Main(String args) {;
    foo = 4
    int bar;
    3 = bar;
    System.out.println( "Foo plus Bar = " foo + bar );
}
```

##Portfolio
Make sure to create a file named `DebuggingChallenge1.java` and save it with the rest of your files for this module. Also, make sure you compile and run your program to verify that it is "bug" free.
