#Login Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

Your challenge is to create a program that requests a username and a password from the user. If the user enters the correct username and password, they are presented with a special message.

**Note:** You may choose what the correct username and password should be.

###Example

*Computer:* `Please enter your username.`

*User:* `Cameron89`

*Computer:* `Please enter your password.`

*User:* `I<3Programming`

*Computer:* `Welcome!`

If the username and password had not been correct, the computer would have said, "Sorry, please try again." and given the user another opportunity to login.

**Note:** As long as the user keeps entering the incorrect login info, the program should continue allowing the user to try again. Achieving this requires a while loop.
