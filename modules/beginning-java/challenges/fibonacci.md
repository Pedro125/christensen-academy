#Project Euler Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes, assuming you already have some experience working with boolean logic and while loops.

You challenge is to write a program that prints out [Fibonacci Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) based on user input.

###Example 1

User inputs `5`.

Program outputs the first 5 Fibonacci numbers: `0 1 1 2 3`.

###Example 2

User inputs `10`.

Program outputs the first 8 Fibonacci numbers: `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34`.

##Portfolio
Create a file named `Fibonacci.java` and save it in the same folder as the rest of your files for this module.
