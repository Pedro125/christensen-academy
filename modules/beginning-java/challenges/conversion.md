#Conversion Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

Your challenge is to write a program that converts from one type of unit to another, such as inches to centimeters or celcius to fahrenheit. You may choose the type of conversion you would like your program to perform. It doesn't have to be scientific. It could be something fun like human years to dog years.

Your program must prompt the user to enter a value, then perform the conversion on the value the user entered and print out the result.

**Note:** Beware of the effects of truncation if integer division is involved.

###Example

The program prompts the user: `Please enter a distance in miles`

The user types in `60`.

The program outputs `60 miles is the same as 96.56064 kilometers`.

##Portfolio
Make sure to save your program as `Conversion.java` and keep it with the rest of your files for this module.
