#Conversion Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

Your challenge is to write a program that converts from one type of unit to another, such as inches to centimeters or celcius to farenheight.

Your program must prompt the user to enter a value, then perform the conversion on the value the user entered and print out the result.

###Example

The program prompts the user: `Please enter a distance in miles`

The user types in `60`.

The program outputs `96.56064 kilometers`.
