#Binary-Decimal-Hexadecimal Conversions Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

Your challenge is to make up some numbers and practice converting them between different number systems, namely binary, decimal, and hexadecimal as these are the most relevant to computers.

Continue doing this until you feel confident that you could represent any number in these three number systems.

Advice: Practice with your favorite number or other numbers that have special significance. It's fun to see your favorite number represented in a different number system. It can also be fun to try to make binary jokes, like "the 11 musketeers" or "111 wonders".
