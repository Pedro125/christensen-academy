#Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal Numbers

###Number Systems
There is more than one way to write a number. For example, the number we call eighty-nine is most commonly written as 89, but only if we're using the decimal (also called base 10) number system. This same number in binary (also called base 2) is written as 1011001. In hexadecimal (also called base 16), however, this number is written as 79.

Sound crazy? Perhaps it is. But, in my opinion, these number systems really aren't that hard to understand. The key is understanding how place value works. Once you've done that, you'll easily be able to work with any number system, even something crazy like base 89!

**Note:** Unless indicated otherwise, you should assume that all numbers in this document are the same as the ones you're used to. That is, assume they are base 10 (the decimal system) numbers.
