#Intermediate Game
###Brick Breaker and Pong Games

In this project, we don't use the main timeline at all. Instead, we set up a document class and control everything through ActionScript, which turns out to be easier (in my opinion). I walk students through creating a Brick Breaker game, which will be a genuine challenge. Then, they will tackle a slightly less complicated creative project: a pong-style game (with a creative twist or two).

Note: My videos on [my website](http://christensenacademy.org) teach how to do all of this stuff.
