##E.T.T.B
A family of four extraterrestrial beings has crash landed on a planet, parachuting to safety before the crash. The impact of the crash was so immense that the planet core has been damaged to the point that the planet will explode in just over 15 minutes. Thankfully, the family's space ship is still usable. But, when they parachuted during the crash, they landed across a great chasm from the ship with no means of crossing. They will never be able to find their way back in just 15 minutes unless another solution presents itself.

And there it is! A tandem bicycle. As everyone knows, extraterrestial beings can fly when they ride Bicycle (think E.T. the movie). 

However, they still may not have enough time to get back to their ship. They can only fit two family members on the tandem bicycle at a time, and everyone rides at different speeds:

* A can cross the chasm in 1 minute.
* B can cross the chasm in 2 minute.
* C can cross the chasm in 4 minute.
* D can cross the chasm in 8 minute.

The mechanics of riding a tandem bicycle through the air are such that the bicycle travels at the rate of the slowest rider. For example, if A and D rode together, it would take them 8 minutes to cross the chasm.

Can you figure out a way to get the entire family back to their ship in 15 minutes or less?

##Robot Hats
You are an intelligent robot. You and two robot friends are subject to the whims of a mad scientist who is your master. One day, the mad scientist has his three robots (you included) play a little game to test your intelligence. First, he sets out five hats. Three of them have spinners on top (call them Spinner Hats). The other two are cowboy hats. Then, the mad scientist turns out the lights. None of the robots can see a thing. While the lights are off, the mad scientist chooses three hats at random and puts them on your heads. But, before he turns the lights back on, he does something unthinkable: he gouges out your robot eye. Your friends are fine, he has only destroyed your eye, which leaves you blind.

Once the lights are back on, you cannot see anything, but your two robot friends can see. While they cannot see their own hats, they can see each other's and yours. The mad scientist does not allow any communication.

Then, the mad scientist asks one of your friends, "What type of hat are you wearing?" Your friend thinks about it and replies, "I don't know."

Next, the mad scientist asks your other friend, "What type of hat are you wearing?" After thinking about it, this friend also replies, "I don't know."

Finally, the mad scientist asks you if you know what type of you're wearing. Despite your lack of vision, you reply with a confident "yes."

How did you know what hat you were wearing?
