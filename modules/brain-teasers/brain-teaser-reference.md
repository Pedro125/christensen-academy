#Brain Teasers Reference Guide

##The Spirit of the Game
The pleasure of a good brain teaser or riddle lies in the seeking and finding on your own. No two people arrive at the solution in the same way. For your own sake, seek not the answer itself. Instead, seek to discover the answer on your own. For the sake of others, do not share answers or even provide clues to others once you know an answer.

##E.T.T.B

[The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihDL-uPYe8)

You are an alien. Your and your three other family members just crash landed on a strange new world. Thankfully, everyone was able to parachute to safety before the crash, but doing so has separated you from from your ship, which you can barely see across a wide chasm in the landscape. What's more, the impact of the crash was so immense that the planet core has been damaged. Your sensors indicate that the planet will explode in just over 15 minutes. Thankfully, your ship is still usable. If only you could get across the chasm in time...

And there you see it. A tandem bicycle. Perfect. Back on your home planet, you were the flying bicycle champion (think E.T.). Now all you have to do is figure out how to get everyon across the chasm in time. Two of you can fit on the bike at a time, so eventually you'll be able to fly everyone back to the ship. Alas, according to the laws of flying bicycle physics, your speed will always be equal to that of the slowest rider on the bike. You're the fastest rider, and you know you can cross the chasm in 1 minute. Your younger brother is a good rider, but too small to be fast. He can cross the chasm in 2 minutes. Your parents are slower. One can cross in 4 minutes and the other in 8 minutes.

Can you figure out a way to save your family from almost certain doom by getting everyone back to the ship in under 15 minutes?

##Robot Hats

[The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FigvXEE2g8w)

You are an intelligent robot. You and two robot friends are subject to the whims of a mad scientist who is your master. One day, the mad scientist has his three robots (you included) play a little game to test your intelligence. First, he sets out five hats. Three of them have spinners on top. The other two are cowboy hats. Then, the mad scientist turns out the lights. None of the robots can see a thing. While the lights are off, the mad scientist chooses three hats at random and puts them on your heads. But, before he turns the lights back on, he does something unthinkable: he gouges out your robot eye rendering you blind! Your robot friends, however, remain unmutilated.

The lights turn back on. While your friends cannot see their own hats, they can see each other's and yours. Beyond this, however, the mad scientist does not allow any communication.

Then, the mad scientist asks one of your friends, "What type of hat are you wearing?" Your friend thinks about it and replies, "I don't know."

Next, the mad scientist asks your other friend, "What type of hat are you wearing?" After thinking about it, this friend also replies, "I don't know."

Finally, the mad scientist asks you if you know what type of you're wearing. Despite your lack of vision, you reply with a confident "yes."

How did you know what hat you were wearing?

##Robo Grid

[The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npxGA8rSWqg)

There is a 3x3 grid of dots on a table. Your robot must pass over each dot. It can only drive in straight lines, and it may only make three turns. Can you make a drawing explaining the path your robot would need to take to accomplish this task?

##Antidote

[The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2PmTw8hnwo)

You've been poisoned. In front of you lies the antidote. Well, kind of...

The antidote will only work if it is an exact mixture of two liquids, blue and red. The red liquid is in a 150 ml beaker to your left, and the blue liquid is in a 150 ml beaker to your right. Both beakers are filled to exactly 150 ml with room at the top for some additional liquid.

After feeding you the poison, your murderer fills a spoon full of the red liquid and dumps it in the blue beaker. Shaking up the mixture, she fills the same spoon full of liquid from the (formerly) blue beaker and dumps it in the red beaker. Both beakers are once again at 150 ml.

"Drinking both will kill you. Only the purest liquid will save you..." she says as she walks away leaving you to face your fate.

##Beeping Bot

[The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnlbJR_mMs0)

Your robot beeps every 0.25 seconds from the moment is starts running. After 30 seconds, how many times has it beeped?

##Robo Progeny

[The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPlFVwQpQRk)

In the future, robots will build robots. Each robot will have creations (robots it built) and a creator (the robot that built it). You are a robot in the future. Ask yourself this:

"If the creation of this other robot is the creator of my creation, what is the relationship between this other robot and myself?"

##Robo Break Dance

Can you move just three of the lines to make a picture of the robot standing on its feet instead?

##Chopsticks

[The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKcxr1jQBeE)

The Chinese restraunt you just ate at only accepts cash. Oops! All you have is a credit card!

To remedy the situation, the chef has presented you a challenge: arrange six chopsticks in such a way that you create 8 perfect equilateral triangles. If you succeed, he lets you go. If you fail, he kills you.

##Axels

[The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoGKPmLjynU)

As you're waiting for your team name to be called at the robotics competition, you start playing with six lego axels in your hands. Is there a way to make exactly 4 perfect equilateral triangles with exaclty 6 axels, you wonder? This strange idea grips your imagination so strongly that you're unable to focus on anything else. Should you fail to find an answer in a timely manner, your team will have to forfeit the robotics competition.

##Spaceship

[The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSYOB04vLqw)

You've been in space since yesterday when your launched at noon. It took you 29 minutes to get to space. You're about to begin your descent and pierce the Earth's atmosphere at 12:03 PM. You estimate that you'll land at 12:27 PM. Will there be any point where you find yourself at the same altitude at the same time both days?

##Doors

[The Video]()

The diagram below represents a course of three walls with increasing numbers of doors in each wall. The diagonal lines represent differnt paths you could take through the course. Each row of doors has one evil robot behind one of the doors. What are your odds of successfully navigating the maze without encountering an evil robot?

##Lazer Cutter

[The Video]()

You want to join the X-Men, but you must first pass an intelligence test. Your mutation is such that your fingernails are harder than diamond and thin enough to cut through almost any material, including metal. Your test is as follows:

A sheet of metal is in front of you, 60 centimeters square. A ring, which you're not allowed to cut, sits beside the metal sheet and measures 11 centimeters in diameter. You must cut the metal into four equal pieces so that they can slip through the ring without bending or breaking.

##Pink Turtles

[The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3emxjmcNnk)

Kristina is the princess of her sandbox. She has even built herself a large sandcastle. In addition to ruling over the sand of her box, she has four pink turtles--Paige, Fanklin, Wilson, and Jack--who live in the sandbox and who are all very intelligent.

Looking for something fun to do, Kristina decides to play a game with her pink turtles. First, she blindfolds them. Then, she paints two of them blue! The turtles don't know who has been painted and who hasn't.

After painting two of the turtles, Kristina puts all of the turtles in a row (all facing the front of the line) and does not allow them to look backwards or communicate in any way with each other. From the front of the line to the back of the line, the turtles are arranged as follows: Paige, Franklin, Wilson, Jack. In addition, Kristina places her sandcastle inbetween Paige and Franklin. Then, she removes their blindfolds.

"I have painted two of you blue!" Kristina exclaims. I will reward you with spicy cake--a rare delicacy for pink turtles--if you can tell me your own color.

Crickets... Then, one of the pink turtles finds the correct answer.

Which turtle won the spicy cake? How did he or she know the correct answer?

##Boating for President

[The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzUI7njSmdw)

You are Mitt Romney in the days leading up to the 2012 U.S. presidential election, and the stress is building. You're having trouble sleeping, and you're having a very, very strange dream. In the dream, you're in a boat trying to cross a river. You're not quite sure how or why, but you know that if you can just manage to cross the river successfully, you'll win the election.

Alas, crossing the river is no simple matter. For some reason, you must also bring a lion, a witch, and a red squirrel across the river with you. Unfortunately, your boat is small, and you can only bring one of these things with you at a time. This wouldn't be much of a problem except for the fact that if left alone, the lion will eat the witch and the witch will kill the squirrel to make a stew. You must find a way to get yourself, the lion, the witch, and the red squirrel across the river without anything or anyone dying. 

Good luck! Your election depends upon it.
