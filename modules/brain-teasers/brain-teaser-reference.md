##The Spirit of the Game
The pleasure of a good brain teaser or riddle lies in the seeking and finding on your own. No two people arrive at the solution in the same way. For your own sake, seek not the answer itself. Instead, seek to discover the answer on your own. For the sake of others, do not share answers or even provide clues to others once you know an answer.

##E.T.T.B
You are an alien. Your and your three other family members just crash landed on a strange new world. Thankfully, everyone was able to parachute to safety before the crash, but doing so has separated you from from your ship, which you can barely see across a wide chasm in the landscape. What's more, the impact of the crash was so immense that the planet core has been damaged. Your sensors indicate that the planet will explode in just over 15 minutes. Thankfully, your ship is still usable. If only you could get across the chasm in time...

And there you see it. A tandem bicycle. Perfect. Back on your home planet, you were the flying bicycle champion (think E.T.). Now all you have to do is figure out how to get everyon across the chasm in time. Two of you can fit on the bike at a time, so eventually you'll be able to fly everyone back to the ship. Alas, according to the laws of flying bicycle physics, your speed will always be equal to that of the slowest rider on the bike. You're the fastest rider, and you know you can cross the chasm in 1 minute. Your younger brother is a good rider, but too small to be fast. He can cross the chasm in 2 minutes. Your parents are slower. One can cross in 4 minutes and the other in 8 minutes.

Can you figure out a way to save your family from almost certain doom by getting everyone back to the ship in under 15 minutes?

##Robot Hats
You are an intelligent robot. You and two robot friends are subject to the whims of a mad scientist who is your master. One day, the mad scientist has his three robots (you included) play a little game to test your intelligence. First, he sets out five hats. Three of them have spinners on top. The other two are cowboy hats. Then, the mad scientist turns out the lights. None of the robots can see a thing. While the lights are off, the mad scientist chooses three hats at random and puts them on your heads. But, before he turns the lights back on, he does something unthinkable: he gouges out your robot eye rendering you blind! Your robot friends, however, remain unmutilated.

The lights turn back on. While your friends cannot see their own hats, they can see each other's and yours. Beyond this, however, the mad scientist does not allow any communication.

Then, the mad scientist asks one of your friends, "What type of hat are you wearing?" Your friend thinks about it and replies, "I don't know."

Next, the mad scientist asks your other friend, "What type of hat are you wearing?" After thinking about it, this friend also replies, "I don't know."

Finally, the mad scientist asks you if you know what type of you're wearing. Despite your lack of vision, you reply with a confident "yes."

How did you know what hat you were wearing?

##Antidote
You've been poisoned. In front of you lies the antidote. Well, kind of...

The antidote will only work if it is an exact mixture of two liquids, blue and red. The red liquid is in a 150 ml beaker to your left, and the blue liquid is in a 150 ml beaker to your right. Both beakers are filled to exactly 150 ml with room at the top for some additional liquid.

After feeding you the poison, your murderer fills a spoon full of the red liquid and dumps it in the blue beaker. Shaking up the mixture, she fills the same spoon full of liquid from the (formerly) blue beaker and dumps it in the red beaker. Both beakers are once again at 150 ml.

"Drinking both will kill you. Only the purest liquid will save you..." she says as she walks away leaving you to face your fate.

##Beeping Bot
Your robot beeps every 0.25 seconds from the moment is starts running. After 30 seconds, how many times has it beeped?

##Symbol Square

Can you place five symbols within each box of this square so that no symbol is repeated in the same row, column, or diagonal?

##Robo Progeny
In the future, robots will build robots. Each robot will have creations (robots it built) and a creator (the robot that built it). You are a robot in the future. Ask yourself this:

"If the creation of this other robot is the creator of my creation, what is the relationship between this other robot and myself?"

##Robo Break Dance
The following is a picture of a robot break dancing (spinning on its head with feet in the air):

Can you move just three of the lines to make a picture of the robot standing on its feet instead?

##Chopsticks
The Chinese restraunt you just ate at only accepts cash. Oops! All you have is a credit card!

To remedy the situation, the chef has presented you a challenge: arrange six chopsticks in such a way that you create 8 perfect equilateral triangles. If you succeed, he lets you go. If you fail, he kills you.

##Space Ship
You've been in space since yesterday when your launched at noon. It took you 29 minutes to get to space. You're about to begin your descent and pierce the Earth's atmosphere at 12:03 PM. You estimate that you'll land at 12:27 PM. Will there be any point where you find yourself at the same altitude at the same time both days?

##Doors
The diagram below represents a course of three walls with increasing numbers of doors in each wall. The diagonal lines represent differnt paths you could take through the course. Each row of doors has one evil robot behind one of the doors. What are your odds of successfully navigating the maze without encountering an evil robot?

##Lazer Cutter
You want to join the X-Men, but you must first pass an intelligence test. Your mutation is such that your fingernails are harder than diamond and thin enough to cut through almost any material, including metal. Your test is as follows:

A sheet of metal is in front of you, 60 centimeters square. A ring, which you're not allowed to cut, sits beside the metal sheet and measures 11 centimeters in diameter. You must cut the metal into four equal pieces so that they can slip through the ring without bending or breaking.
