##Christensen Academy Example
###Script
Welcome to the Christensen Academy, where you can learn about computers and computer programming for free.

Hi, my name is Cameron Christensen, and I hope to help you learn about...
* computer science
* Web development
* Game Maker
* Processing
* Java
* Flash
* image manipulation
* and more!

So far, my focus has been on creating YouTube videos and organizing them into easy-to-use playlists. I've also begun to create reference guides to supplement each playlist, which is especially helpful for learning programming.

Not only are the videos free, but the software you need is free too! All you need is a regular computer. Mac, Windows, or Linux will work just fine.

The Christensen Academy will continue to evolve and improve over time. It should be an exciting journey, and I hope you stick around for the ride.

Kowabunga!
