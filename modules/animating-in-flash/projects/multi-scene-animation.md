#Multi-Scene Animation

Your goal is to create a multi-scene animation that could serve a real purpose in this wonderful, crazy ol', mixed-up world of ours.

##Project Suggestions
* Comedy: the purpose of your animation is to make people laugh.
* Art: the purpose of your animation is purely artistic.
* Advertisement: your animation could be used as an advertisement.
* Music Video: your animation could be used as (a small part) of a music video.

Of course, your animation could serve another purpose that I didn't list. The ideas above are just suggestions.

##Requirement
* Length: Unless it is incredibly detailed, it should be at least 8 seconds long (suggested frame rate of 24fps)
* Detail: It should look like a finished product. For example, if you use a white background, it should be because that what you wanted, not because you just didn't get around to it.
* Animation: You may use any and all types of animation that you'd like to complete this project.
* Sound: You must use sound effects to accompany your animation. You may also use music if you'd like to.
* Scenes: You must effectively use multiple scenes for this animation.
* Playback Controls: You must effectively use playback controls on your animation. If you would prefer not to use playback controls on your animation, you may instead settle for an opening menu screen.

#Demonstrating Mastery
Demonstrating mastery on this project will require you to clearly show that you have aquired strong control over the following:
* The various animation techniques
* The concept of having an animation inside of a symbol
* Putting sound inside of animations
* Using scenes
* Creating a Menu Screen with a "play" button and a "credits" button. The credits putton will take the user to a static page showing the credits.
