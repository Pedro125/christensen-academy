#Project: Single Scene Animation

Your goal is to create an interesting animation using the animation techniques you've learned so far, such the following:

* frame-by-frame animations
* motion tweens
* bone tool
* movie clip animations
  * an animated symbol inside of another symbol, which in turn is animated (think butterfly example)
  * pan, zoom, and fade

##Suggested Projects
You are free to choose what you'd like for this animation, but here are some suggestions that you can use if you're not feeling particularly creative:

* A hand moving checkers on a checkerboard.
* A soccer player scoring a goal.
* An octopus on the prowl for dinner.

**Note:** I highly recommend not starting from scratch on this project. To the extent that you can, use graphics you've already developed.

##Requirements
The most important requirement is to make good use of symbols. Name them intelligently. When you have an animation inside a symbol, make sure to label it as such. You need at least one symbol that contains an instance of another symbol that has animation in its timeline.

* frame-by-frame animations
* motion tweens
* bone tool (optional)
* movie clip animations
  * an animated symbol inside of another symbol, which in turn is animated (think butterfly example)
  * pan, zoom, and fade

##Mastery
Demonstrating mastery on this project requires you to hit all of the requirements with a high level of expertise and control.
