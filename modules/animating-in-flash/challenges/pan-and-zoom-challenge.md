#Pan and Zoom Challenge

Your challenge is to create an animation in a scene of some kind and then pan and zoom in or out on that scene as the animation plays.

**Key Idea:** You need to put your entire scene into a movie clip symbol. Then, you can add a motion tween to that symbol on scene1. With the transform tool, you'll be able to resize (zoom) and move (pan) the scene.

##Mastery
Demonstrating mastery on this challenge means the following:

1. The pan is used effectively
2. A zoom is used effectively
3. The scene itself has a non-trivial, interesting animation inside of it.
