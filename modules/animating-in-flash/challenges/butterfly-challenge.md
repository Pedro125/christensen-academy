#Butterfly Challenge

[a video explaining the challenge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyfmC20WAiU)

Your challenge is to animate a butterfly moving about the screen and flapping its wings as it goes. Try to make it look as realistic as possible. Check out [my example](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/blob/master/modules/animating-in-flash/challenges/butterfly.fla?raw=true) for ideas.

##Helpful Things to Think About
* You can't do it all at once. Take time to think about what symbols you'll need and which ones should have animations in them.
* Transformation points will undoubtedly help you animate your wings.
* You can animate wings using either frame-by-frame animations or motion tweens.
* You should probably use a motion tween for making your butterfly move about the screen. Would a frame-by-frame animation even work?
* When you select a motion tween, you can view its properties in the properties panel. There is a checkbox called "align to path." If you can figure out what this does, it will undoubtedly help you.

##Mastery
Demonstrating mastery on this challenge means the following:
1. Your butterfly looks reasonably realistic.
2. Both wings flap or flutter in such a way that they remain connected to the body.
3. The butterfly faces forwards as it flys around.
4. Symbols were used effectively and named intelligently.
