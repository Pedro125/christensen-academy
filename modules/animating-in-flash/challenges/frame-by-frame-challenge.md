#Challenge 1: Frame-by-Frame Animation

Your challenge is to create an objectively awesome frame-by-frame animation.

Here are some ideas to get you thinking:

* A bird flapphing wings
* A candle flame flickering
* A basketball going through a hoop
* A hand opening or closing
* Pacman runnin' around eating stuff
* A stick figure walking

Of course, these are just a few ideas of things to try.

My Advice: Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.
