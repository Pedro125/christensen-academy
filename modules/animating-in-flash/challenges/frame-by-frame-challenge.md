#Frame-by-Frame Animation

Your challenge is to create an interesting frame-by-frame animation.

Here are some ideas to get you thinking:

* A bird flapphing wings
* A candle flame flickering
* A basketball going through a hoop
* A hand opening or closing
* Pacman runnin' around eating stuff
* A stick figure walking

Of course, these are just a few ideas of things to try.

*My Advice: Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.*

1. Your timeline has at least 10 keyframes, and the animation progresses smoothly from one frame to the next.
2. You've attempted something unique and interesting.
3. There aren't any major flaws in what you've done.
