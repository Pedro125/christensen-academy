#Multi-Scene Animation

Your goal is to create a multi-scene animation that could serve a real purpose in this wonderful, crazy ol', mixed-up world of ours.

##Project Suggestions
* Comedy: the purpose of your animation is to make people laugh.
* Advertisement: your animation could be used as an advertisement.
* Music Video: your animation could be used as (a small part) of a music video.
* Art: the purpose of your animation is purely artistic.

Of course, your animation could serve another purpose that I didn't list. The ideas above are just suggestions.

##Requirements
* Plan and Schedule: At the start of the project, a general plan for completing the project must be devised and recorded on paper. In addition, a work log must be completed each day providing an overview of what was worked on.
* Length: Unless it is incredibly detailed, it should be at least 8 seconds long (suggested frame rate of 24fps)
* Detail: It should look like a finished product. For example, if you use a white background, it should be because that what you wanted, not because you just didn't get around to it.
* Animation: You may use any and all types of animation that you'd like to complete this project.
* Sound: You must use sound effects to accompany your animation. You may also use music if you'd like to.
* Scenes: You must effectively use multiple scenes for this animation.
* Playback Controls: You must effectively use playback controls on your animation. If you would prefer not to use playback controls on your animation, you may instead settle for an opening menu screen.

#Demonstrating Mastery
Demonstrating mastery on this project will require you to clearly show that you have aquired strong control over the following:
* The various animation techniques
* The concept of having an animation inside of a symbol
* Putting sound inside of animations
* Using scenes
* Creating a Menu Screen with a "play" button and a "credits" button. The credits putton will take the user to a static page showing the credits.

##Rubric (200 points)
The Rubric for this project is simple: 20 points for each of the requirements and an additional 60 points for an overall quality rating.

For projects being completed in teams, everyone on that team is expected to put for similar amounts of effort. To the extent that there is a noticeable imbalance in work ethic and contribution, points may be deducted in accordance with the degree of imbalance.
