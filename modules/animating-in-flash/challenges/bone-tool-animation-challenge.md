#Bone Tool Animation Challenge

[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkHC1IrO3No) introduces and explains the challenge. For most of it you'll notice that my voice is high-pitched. You're welcome. I had to do that to speed up the video and fit it in under YouTube's 15-minute limit.

This is not a creative project. Your goal is precision replication.

##Mastery
You attempted the challenge without watching the full video and your replica was nearly flawless.
