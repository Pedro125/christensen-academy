#Animating in Flash

In addition to drawing, Flash can be used as an animation tool. In my course, after teaching the basics of animating in Flash, I lead students through a bouncing ball example, which utilizes the main timeline as well as other movie clip timelines. Then, students create their own creative projects to test their animating skills. Here are some of the suggestions I give:

* Butterflies (flapping wings, flying around the screen, causing general mayhem...)
* Cars (driving around, wheels spinning)
* Talking (mouth moving up and down, eyebrows changing to show expressions ... think South Park...)

Note: My videos on [my website](http://christensenacademy.org) teach how to do animations in Flash.
