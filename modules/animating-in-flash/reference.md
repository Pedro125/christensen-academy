#Animating in Flash Reference

##The Timeline
The Flash Timeline, in addition to organizing layers, shows information about animations. In particular, it shows you everything you'd want to know about the various types of frames in your animation.
###Frames and Keyframes
All forms of video work off of the idea of frames. In the early days of animation, artists worked tirelessly to draw and paint each frame of an animation. When these frames were viewed in rapid succession, the illusion of motion was created. Animations in Flash are no different in the sense that they work on a frame by frame basis. However, animating in Flash is easier than traditional animation thanks to something called *tweens*. With tweens, you are able to specify special frames called *keyframes*, and Flash will fill in the rest of the frames for you. 
###Frame Rates
The default frame rate in Flash is 24 fps (frames per second). You can change this. If you want your animation to speed up, simply set the frame rate higher (e.g., 48 fps would be twice as fast as the default speed). If you want your animation to slow down, simply decrease the frame rate (e.g., 12 fps would be half as fast as the default speed).

Note: Low frame rates appear choppy while fast frame rates appear smooth.

##Frame by Frame Animation
The most straitforward type of animation is frame-by-frame animation. In frame-by-frame animation, every frame is a keyframe, so you must specify how everything is arranged on each frame. Because of this, frame-by-frame animations are only used when necessary, and often only for very short, repetitive animations. Here are a few examples of times a frame-by-frame animation might be the right tool for the job:

* A flower swaying in the wind
* A character walking
* An explosion in a game

##Motion Tweens
There are three main types of tweens: motion tweens, classic tweens (a remnant of previous versions of Flash), and shape tweens. Of these three types, motion tweens are by far the most important.

Motion tweens allow you to take a symbol and set two or more keyframes on it. Flash will take note of your keyframes and automatically fill in the frames between the keyframes.

Note: Creating successful motion tweens requires you to always know where the playhead is at. When you manipulate an object on the stage, remember that you only changing its position on the frame your playhead is at, which may automatically create a new keyframe.

##Timelines in Symbols
It is very important to realize that symbols have their own inner timelines. When you edit a symbol, you will see a timeline specific to that symbol. The way this works is slightly different for each type of symbol, but I will be focusing on movie clip symbols in this document.
