100 points total

##Written (Take Home Test)
40 points

This portion of the test will involve two short answer questions. Each will present a theoretical animation challenge (e.g., animated a butterfly flying to a flower and coming to a rest), and the student's job will be to describe how he or she would go about creating the specified animation. 

* What symbols would be required?
* Which ones would have animations?
* What types of animations would be used? Why?

Responses should be one or two paragraphs in length with supporting illustrations. The writing is worth 15 points and the illustrations are worth 5 points. Your goal is to clearly communicate your gameplan for creating the animation in question.

###Possible Questions
* How would you create an animation of a candle flickering?
* How would you create an animation of a cartoon character talking or singing?
* How would you create an animation of a car driving over a bump in the road (side view)?
* How would you create an animation of a clock (not digital) with second, minute, and hour hands?
* How would you create an animation of a helicopter flying across the screen?
* How would you create an animation of Tarzan swinging on jungle ropes?
* How would you create an animation of a plate falling and shattering?
