#Basic Game
###A "Dodge" Game in which a Player either Dodges or Collects Objects Flying Across the Screen

Leading up to this project is a lot of learning the basics of ActionScript. With that foundation in hand, I walk students through this example dodge game. Then, students are asked to take the same concepts and transfer them to a new creative project of their own.

Note: You'll notice that we're writing ActionScript in the Actions Panel for this game, and we're using code to control the main timeline. In the next game, we'll remove the main timeline code and use only ActionScript classes.

Note: My videos on [my website](http://christensenacademy.org) teach how to do all of this stuff.
