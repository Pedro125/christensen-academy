#Redefining "Difficult"

> *"It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer." -Albert Einstein*

As I think back on my own education--which is still in progress and will never be complete--I tend to remember those experiences that forced me to redefine my understanding of what it means for a problem to be difficult. I eventually learned to think about the difficulty of problems less in terms of whether or not I could solve them and more in terms of how long it would take me to solve them.

The purpose of this textpage is simply to share three examples from my own life where I solved problems that forced me to redefine "difficult".

###Dragon Puzzle
When I was in middle school, I borrowed a dragon puzzle from a friend. The goal of the puzzle was to separate a metal ring from the larger metal dragon structure. There were some other rings on the puzzle and some string that was woven throughout the entire thing too.

When I got home, I began trying to solve the puzzle and soon got frustrated. I remember being about ready to give up, but for some reason I stuck with it. The puzzle was so complicated that it was hard to tell if I was actually making progress. But after a while, my understanind of the puzzle began to grow. After what I recall being several hours on a lazy Saturday afternoon, I finally solved the puzzle. I was extremely excited... until I realized I needed to put the whole thing back together again.

At that point in my life, this puzzle was easily the hardest problem I had ever solved. I had certainly never tackled such a difficult problem in school. My success with this puzzle gave me confidence. To this day, I am tremendously grateful for that experience. It played a big role in shaping how I approached problems in the future.

###Geometry Proof
In math class, for example, I became far less intimidated by problems that might take twenty minutes to figure out. When I reached 9th grade, I found myself in Geometry class. One day at the end of class, the teacher presented one additional problem "just for fun" at the end of the lesson. I probably never would have attempted this problem were it not for being injured and unable to participate in basketball practice, which lasted roughly two hours. While I was sitting on the sidelines at basketball practice, I opened my math book and focused on that problem. As with the dragon puzzle, I soon became frustrated and was ready to quit. But, for some reason, I decided to stick with it. Roughly two hours later, I had a solution that I knew was correct.

When I got to school the next day, the teacher asked if anyone had solved the problem, so I shared my solution (a Euclidean geometry solution). After seeing my solution, the teacher presented a different solution (an analytic geometry solution) that was equally correct--though, quite frankly, my solution was significantly simpler.

At that point in my life, that was the most difficult math problem I had ever solved. As with the dragon puzzle, this success gave me a lot of conficence. What amazed me, however, was that I knew I wasn't that smart. The reason for my success had almost nothing to do with my intelligence and almost everything to do with the simple fact that I refused to give up on the problem until it was solved.

As I looked at my classmates around me, I realized that most of them defined "difficult" quite a bit differently than the way I was beginning to. Whereas most of my classmates were probably only willing to stick with a difficult math problem for about ten minutes before giving up. All of a sudden I found myself face to face with the fact that I had just spend over two hours working on a single problem. All of a suddent the problems my classmates considered difficult seemed to me to be relatively easy. It wasn't that I'd all of a sudden gotten smarter. Rather, I had redefined what difficult meant to me.

###Sudoku Program
I more or less stumbled upon computer science in college and fell in love with it. I enjoyed the problem solving it presented me. After my first programming course in college, I decided to see if I could write a program that solved Sudoku puzzles. I wrote my program in the Java programming language, which I was only beginning to really understand at the time. I had no idea how long this project would take, but for some reason it seemed like an extremely interesting challenge.

This was my first real attempt to do any programming that wasn't directly assigned by a professor, and I soon found myself making tons of errors. After what I imagine was close to 30 or 40 hours of work, I finally finished my program. It wasn't much to look at, but it worked against every sudoku puzzle I could find.

As with the Dragon Puzzle and the Geometry proof before, I emerged from this experience with a lot of confidence in my ability to solve problems that a lot of other people would probably give up on. My personal definition of "difficult" was forced to shift once again. The coding assignments I encountered in class no longer seemed very difficult, at least not relative to the Sudoku program I had completed just for fun.

###Conclusion

As you continue on with your education, I encourage you to look for opportunities to tackle problems that stretch your personal understanding of "difficult". These problems won't always be presented by your teachers; sometimes you'll need to seek them out on your own. I hope you learn to relish the genuinely difficult challenges you find in front of you. As you solve increasingly difficult problems, your confidence will grow until you begin to believe that there is no problem you are only incapable of solving. Maybe someday you will be quoted saying the same as Einstein, "It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer."
