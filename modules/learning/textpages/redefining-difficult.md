#Redefining "Difficult"

> *"It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer." -Albert Einstein*

As I think back on my own education--which is still in progress and will never be complete--I tend to remember those experiences that forced me to redefine my understanding of what it means for a problem to be difficult. I eventually learned to think about the difficulty of problems less in terms of whether or not I could solve them and more in terms of how long it would take me to solve them.

###Experience 1: Dragon Puzzle
When I was in middle school, I borrowed a puzzle from a friend that I saw at his house (I tried to find a picture of it online to show you but couldn't). The goal of the puzzle was to separate a metal ring from the larger metal dragon structure. There were some other rings on the puzzle and some string that was woven throughout the entire thing too.

When I got home, I began trying to solve the puzzle. I soon got frustrated. I remember feeling frustrated and about ready to give up, but for some reason I stuck with it. I remember feeling a growing sense of understanding of the puzzle, though I was never quite sure if I was really making progress. After what I recall as being an entire afternoon, I finally solved the puzzle.

At that point in my life, this puzzle was easily the hardest problem I had ever solved.

As you continue on with your education, I encourage you to look for opportunities to tackle problems that stretch your personal understanding of "difficult". Learn to relish the challenge, and don't cheat yourself out of opportunities to grow. As you solve increasingly difficult problems, your confidence will grow until you begin to believe that there is no problem you are only incapable of solving. Maybe someday you will be quoted saying the same as Einstein, "It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer."

##Video Games
Video games do an excellent job of presenting us with problems that are just at the edge of our abilities. Video games are designed to make us feel successful. It is not in the interest of game designers to make them so hard that most people would give up. However,
