#Polya Problem Solving
In 1945, a mathematician name George Polya described a method of problem solving in a book titled [How to Solve It](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It). This textpage is my adaptation of his 4-step problem solving method. I hope you find this method helpful as you begin computer programming.

##Step 1: Understand the Problem
As strange as it may seem, many people make the mistake of trying to solve a problem they don't actually understand. To make sure you really understand the problem you're about to try to solve, try asking yourself these questions:

* Can I restate the problem in my own words?
* How will I know if I have found a solution?
* Is this problem similar to another problem I have already encountered?

##Step 2: Make a Plan
There are many ways to solve problems. Some work better than others in different situations. We learn through experience which methods work best for us. Here are some suggested methods to get you started:

* **Guess and Check:** Some of the most successful programmers I know are exceptionally good at this method. They are brilliant at creating brief testing scenarios that tell them what they need to know. This method is also a great way to learn, not just to solve problems.
* **Eliminate Possibilities:** This is a very helpful debugging strategy when you can't seem to get your computer programs to work. Some errors can be tricky, and often the easiest way to solve them is by eliminating possible sources of the error.
* **Make a Step-by-Step Plan:** Sometimes it works to look at the problem and devise a series of steps that will lead you to a solution.
* **Be Lazy-Smart:** Think: "Is there an easier way to do this that doesn't require so much effort?"
* **Examine related problems:** Rarely will a problem be completely unique. Draw on your past experience with related problems to envision a solution.
* **Logical Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Especially when writing computer code, we can often detect errors when we force ourselves to go step-by-step through our code, thinking carefully about what's happening each step of the way.
* **Divide and Conquer:** Break the problem up into smaller, easier problems that can be solved individually.
* **Work Backwards:** Start by imagining the problem is solved and work backwards imagining the process that would have lead to that point.

##Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
It may happen that the plan you devised in step 2 doesn't work. If so, devise another plan and try again. This is how even the best computer scientists and programmers work. They make plenty of mistakes, but they stay with problems and continue trying new strategies until they final solve the problem at hand.

##Step 4: Look Back on Your Work
It's always tempting when working with computers to accept solutions we don't fully understand. However, the best computer scientists and programmers are always those who take the time to go back and make sure that they fully understand the solution they've arrived at. Here are some things you should do as you look back on your work:

* **Consider special cases:** Will this work under all circumstances?
* **Look for a better solution:** Is there a faster solution? Is there a simpler solution that would be easier to understand?
* **Examine your process:** Could you have solved the problem more easily if you had approached it differently?
