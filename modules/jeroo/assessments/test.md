One Jeroo, Juliet, must start at (1, 1). The other Jeroo, Romeo, must start at (1, 22). Romeo's goal is to give as many flowers as possible to Juliet.

You will earn different amounts of points on this test in accordance with the quantity of flowers Romeo gives Juliet.

##About the Maps

No extra water is added to the square map except for two perfectly horizontal "streams" described below.

The top three rows of each map are EXACTLY the same. This will not change.

The next one or more rows are filled with open space except for a singlt flower placed randomly.

The first stream is 2 squares wide. A bridge crosses it at a random location. The North square of the bridge has a trap.

The next one or more rows are filled lots of flowers scattered randomly about.

The second stream is 2 squares wide. A bridge crosses it at a random location. The North square of the bridge has a trap.

The next two or more rows are filled with a combination of traps and flowers.

##Easy

Romeo starts with three flowers. Romeo must use two to disable the traps outside of Romeo and Juliet's starting locations. Romeo must give the last one to Juliet.

##Medium

Romeo starts with two flowers. Romeo must collect a third to have enough to disarm the traps and give one to Juliet.

##Hard

Romeo wants to give more flowers to Juliet. He must use one to one of his first two flowers to disarm the trap to cross the bridge to the field full of flowers. After collecting some flowers, he gives as many as possible to Juliet.

##Insane

Romeo wants to maximize the number of flowers he can give to Juliet. He must cross both bridges and collect as many flowers in both areas as possible.
