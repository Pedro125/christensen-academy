    <h1>History of Computers: Classroom Simulations</h1>
    
    <h2>Simulation 1: Astronomical Computations for the Royal Society of London</h2>
    <h3>Setting</h3>
    <p>The year is 1820. You have been hired as a computer (a person who computers) by the Royal Society of London to perform basic mathematical calculations that will be used to further the study of astronomy. Your results will be recorded in mathematical tables that scientists will reference as they perform their own calculations. Accuracy is <em>essential</em>.</p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
      On the card you've been given, you're asked to compute simple additions.
      <ol>
        <li>Add the topmost number (that you haven't already used) in the left column with the bottommost number in the right column.</li>
        <li>Write your answer in the appropriate space (the topmost, empty in the right column).</li>
        <li>Repeat the previous two steps until the table is complete.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Points to Consider</h3> 
    <ul>
      <li>In the 1800s, computers did not exist.</li>
      <li>The solution was to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_table">mathematical tables</a> and record them in giant books.</li>
      <li>This solution was inadequate for reasons that you've hopefully discovered through this simulation</li>
      <li>In the 1830s, a man named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babbage">Charles Babbage</a> set to work on creating a device that could compute by mechanical means, called the difference engine. Sadly, it was never completed.</li>
      <li>Babbage also had dreams of building a better machine that could serve a much wider array of purposes, called the Analytical Engine. The designs and concepts for the machine were incredibly similar to modern computers. Sadly, this too was never built, and his dream died with him in 1871</li>
      <li>For many decades, the idea of a computer was lost...</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Simulation 2: Calculating Shell Trajectories for the US Army</h2>
    <p>The year is 1943. You are an American. World War II is in full swing. You have been hired by the U.S. military to calculate firing trajectories for military shells. The success of our war efforts relies on your calculations being fast and accurate.</p>
    <h3>Points to Consider</h3> 
    <ul>
      <li>The ENIAC was the first electronic general purpose computer.</li>
      <li>The ENIAC was started in 1943 for the sole purpose of calculating firing trajectories for the war.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Simulation 3: Breaking Codes</h2>
    <p>It's World War II. You've been hired by the British government to break coded messages intercepted from German transmissions.</p>
    <p>Break this code using a ceasar cipher (no need to decode the numbers): AEXGL KMERX FVEMRW XS 35:22</p>
    <h3>Points to Consider</h3> 
    <ul>
      <li>The difference between breaking a code in a couple days vs. breaking a code in a couple of hours...</li>
      <li>Computers have always been able to do more than just math.</li>
    </ul>
