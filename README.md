#Christensen Academy

This code is for the [Christensen Academy website](http://christensenacademy.org)

##Mission Statement

To create a free, world-class educational system for learning introductory computer science.

##Current State

The Christensen Academy at this point couldn't be much simpler. There are YouTube playlists organized a single webpage. In addition, there are a growing number of reference guides to support each playlist that are especially helpful for programming types of activities.

The design of the site relies heavily upon bootstrap. Keeping it to just a single page helps me maintain it as easily as possible.

##Trello Board
The things I'm currently working on can be found on a [Trello board](https://trello.com/board/christensen-academy/5059b85d7f98542c3d7c367e).

##Evolving Vision

This is my ultimate vision for the Christensen Academy.

###Dynamics

* Free, easy login
* Completion (winning) is possible(estimated 300 hours of gameplay)
  * Complete exercises
  * Complete challenges
  * Complete projects
  * Complete modules, which are composed of exercises, challenges, and one or more projects
* Sandbox with implicitly suggested paths
  * All content is accessible anytime, but more points and badges are possible if it's done "right"
* Content delivery through interactive on-demand video
  * In-video quizzing
    * Frequent, short, and timed
    * Prerecorded comments from me (think NBA Jam announcer)
  * Improved playback controls and scrubbing
  * SoundCloud-style commenting
* Khan-style exercises
* Peer evaluation of challenges
* Peer evaluation of projects (more involved and rigorous than for challenges)
* Community contests
* Always a small step away from achieving something new.
  * Challenges are short and frequent.
  * Exercises are modular.
  * Videos in a playlist are shorter at the beginning and longer near the end.
  * etc.

**NOTE:** The greatest joys need to be learning, creating, sharing, and helping others, and the dynamics of the system need to foster these feeling in users.

###Mechanics

* Challenges
  * Watching and learning from videos
    * Mini-challenges in the video itself
  * Completing and uploading challenges and projects for peer review
  * Actually doing the peer review
  * Finishing out modules
* Chance
  * In competitions
  * In dynamically generated exercises
* Competition
  * Peer evaluation system
* Cooperation
  * Peer evaluation system
  * Comments in videos
* Rewards
  * Points
  * Progress bar for each course
* Quests
  * Used as a mechanism to make meaningful links between differing content areas.
