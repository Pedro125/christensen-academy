##Mission Statement

To create a free, world-class education platform for learning introductory computer science.

##Current State of Affairs

My name is Cameron Christensen, and I'm the only person working on this project right now. I'm a high school CS teacher, and some of the content I'm developing for the Christensen Academy is being used

##Playlists, Challenges, and Reference Guides

I'm using YouTube to host my video content, which is pretty rapidly growing. I started recording videos in June of 2012, and as of the end of October 2012, I already have over 360 videos on YouTube. Of course, this says nothing of their quality, and I'm still learning as I go.

The videos alone are a great start, but just watching videos isn't enough to really learn the material at a deep level. For this reason, I'm developing challenge maps for each of the modules. These maps present a neatly scaffolded system of challenges for learners to overcome, the idea being that when a learner has completed all of the challenges, he or she has likely learned the content of the module at a deep level. I should also note that some of these challenges are far more open-ended than others. The more open-ended challenges I'm calling projects, and these often come near the end of a module. The idea behind a project is that it's a good way for a learner to use their skills in a more creative, real-world application. This, I think is essential for cultivating long-lasting knowledge.

To supplement the videos and the challenges, I'm also creating reference guides, which are somewhat like mini textbooks for each module. The idea behind these is that it isn't all that fun to rewatch a video just to find one small piece of info. It's much more efficient in such cases to look at a quick reference sheet. GitHub is helping me a lot with this, as I'm using markdown and GitHub's syntax highlighting for my code examples. These reference guides, in my humble opinion, have the potential to be better and more useful than a traditional textbook. And, in my opinion, they're the least important part of the Christensen Academy at this point. The videos and challenge maps are far more important for learning.

##Self-Pacing

I will measure the success of the Christensen Academy based on it's effectiveness at empowering learners to work at their own pace in a highly effective, efficient, and enjoyable manner. Each module, then, can be thought of as a self-paced unit of study. Only once a student has demonstrated true mastery on a module with he or she be able to andvance to another one.
