#Christensen Academy

This code is for the [Christensen Academy website](http://christensenacademy.org)

##Mission Statement

To create a free, world-class educational system for learning introductory computer science.

##Current State

The Christensen Academy at this point couldn't be much simpler. It's basically a giant page of links with two main benefits:

* A responsive design thanks to bootstrap
* Easy maintenance--it's just one page...

##Evolving Vision

This is my ultimate vision for the Christensen Academy.

###Dynamics

* Free, easy login
* Completion (winning) is possible(estimated 300 hours of gameplay)
  * Complete exercises
  * Complete challenges
  * Complete projects
  * Complete modules, which are composed of exercises, challenges, and one or more projects
* Sandbox with implicitly suggested paths
  * All content is accessible anytime, but more points and badges are possible if it's done "right"
* Content delivery through interactive on-demand video
  * In-video quizzing
    * Frequent, short, and timed
    * Prerecorded comments from me (think NBA Jam announcer)
  * Improved playback controls and scrubbing
  * SoundCloud-style commenting
* Khan-style exercises
* Peer evaluation of challenges
* Peer evaluation of projects (more involved and rigorous than for challenges)
* Community contests
* Always a small step away from achieving something new.
  * Challenges are short and frequent.
  * Exercises are modular.
  * Videos in a playlist are shorter at the beginning and longer near the end.
  * etc.

**NOTE:** The greatest joys need to be learning, creating, sharing, and helping others, and the dynamics of the system need to foster these feeling in users.

###Mechanics

* Challenges
  * Watching and learning from videos
    * Mini-challenges in the video itself
  * Completing and uploading challenges and projects for peer review
  * Actually doing the peer review
  * Finishing out modules
* Chance
  * In competitions
  * In dynamically generated exercises
* Competition
  * Peer evaluation system
* Cooperation
  * Peer evaluation system
  * Comments in videos
* Rewards
  * Points
  * Progress bar for each course
* Quests
  * Used as a mechanism to make meaningful links between differing content areas.
