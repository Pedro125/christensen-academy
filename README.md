#Christensen Academy

The [Christensen Academy](http://christensenacademy.org) is a project I started in June 2012. The idea was and still is to create an educational gateway to the world of computer science and programming.

To date, the main feature of the site has been the YouTube videos I've been recording. However, I've also begun building challenge maps and textpages (reference guides) to supplement the video playlists for each learning module.

The content of the challenge maps and textpages written in markdown, which you can see in the module folders.

Please send me an email at cameron@christensenacademy.org if you're interested in this project.

Kowabunga,

Cam
