#Christensen Academy

This code is for the [Christensen Academy website](http://christensenacademy.org)

##Mission Statement

To create a free, world-class educational system for learning introductory computer science.

##Current State

The Christensen Academy at this point couldn't be much simpler. There are YouTube playlists organized a single webpage.

I'm also trying to provide meaningful challenges an projects to support the learning process.

Lastly, there are a growing number of reference guides to support each playlist that are especially helpful for programming types of activities.

The design of the site relies heavily upon bootstrap. Keeping it to just a single page helps me maintain it as easily as possible.

##Trello Board
The things I'm currently working on can be found on a [Trello board](https://trello.com/board/christensen-academy/5059b85d7f98542c3d7c367e).
