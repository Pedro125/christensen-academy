#US Curriculum

This is just me spitballin' here. Please don't take this too seriously if you read it. I'm just playing around with ideas. No harm intended.

##Overview
The existing model of education is very rigid, and with this rigidity comes obvious major problems. I contest that our adherance to this rigid system is no longer necessary or wise if we know how to leverage technology in the right way. This document lays out my vision for the basis of a new, more flexible model that would be much better for teachers, students, and all other parties involved.

But, what do we mean by "education"? Surely, a computer can't replace a teacher, can it? That depends, I think, upon what the teacher does in the classroom. If the teacher is a meer disseminator of knowledge spending most of his or her time in direct lecture, then yes, such a teacher can be replaced by videos and software. In fact, I've come to believe that on-demand video beats a traditional class lecture in almost every way imaginable. In terms of building basic knowledge and understanding, online education platforms like the Khan Academy are hard to beat.

But, education is about more than building a basic knowledge base. It's about digging deep and striving for true engagement.

From my perspective, the primary use of technology should be to empower students to build
