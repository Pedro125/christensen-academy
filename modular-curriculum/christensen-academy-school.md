##Founding Tenets
* K-Life
* Family Enrollment
* Modules
  * Self-paced
  * Parent and Guardian
  * Pass-fail/mastery
  * content-delivery via system not teacher
  * teacher as coach
  * creative, real-world application of knowledge to complete a module
  * portfolio + summative assessment + interview = module completion
  
* Age-level curriculum (not self-paced)
  * Similar to grade levels, but only for some subjects and only in certain areas. Some room for electives here, but not much. Most freedom comes in the self-paced modules.
  * Lots of this curriculum involves special lectures, field trips, inquiry-based learning, etc. Because learning content is not the focus here, this curriculum offers the best of what the current model hopes to be.
* Academic competitions
* The Arts (for all ages)
* Sports (for all ages)
* Right of passage: students become teachers conferring real credit at age 14.
* Full freedom over courses at age 16.


##K-Life
Students at the Dakota School aren't just kids. The Dakota School learning community is composed of people of all ages. Students at the Dakota School never stop learning. Thus, there is no such thing as graduation.

##Family Enrollment
Child . Grandparents are highly encouraged to enroll as well if possible. The achievement requirements for adults will be less than students

##Academics
###Modules and Age-Level Curriculum
Academics are split between self-paced modules and age-level curriculum.
####Modules
Modules are much shorter than courses and in some ways are more similar to what might be referred to as units in the traditional system. The greatest difference is that these modules are self-paced, and completion of a module requires true demonstration of mastery. In this way, traditional grading schemes have no meaning for Dakota School students.

In self-paced modules, individual teachers will evaluate mastery and otherwise serve as a coach to the students. Teachers will NOT be the main presenter's of conent to their students, at least not at the front of the room as in a traditional lecture.

####Age-Level Curriculum
As students advance through the school, they must also complete the age-level curriculum, which is not self-paced, though it still takes a modular form. Individual teachers create learning modules with a heavy focus on inquiry and real-world problem solving. At the end of each module, students receive performance reviews from teachers, but traditional grades are not given.

###Portfolios
Modules place emphasis on creative application of learning. At the end of each module, students will have produced a body of work that will be organized in a portfolio.
