Levels are also major milestones in a learner's career, comparable to graduating to the next level of school, except that one's level is more a mark of distinction and comes with new privelages. Advancing a learning level is a rite of passage and comes with great ceremony. It is an achievement. The school community is recognizing a learner for having grown in the **5 Scholarly Virtues** (described below).
  * **(Level 1) Young Learner:** Fewer self-paced modules. Self-paced modules are shorter (2-10 hours for completion). Majority of learning is lead by a teacher who leads students through authentic inquiry.
  * **(Level 2) Novice Learner** More self-paced modules and more opportunity to choose modules. Module coach plays less hands-on role.
  * **(Level 3) Intermediate Learner:** Even more self-paced modules and almost full choice over modules. Coach is very hands-off.
  * **(Level 4) Advanced Learner:** Full freedom to explore and complete modules and even "off-road" into uncharted learning territory and still earn credit, though mastery must still be assessed by others. Ability to join a learning guild, although learning guilds must always be composed of at least three master learners.
  * **(Level 5) Master Learner:** This is the highest level attainable and signifies special status in a learning guild. No restrictions on learning methods that can be credentialed. Learning can be self reported and self evaluated, though it must still be approved by one's learning guild.
* **5 Scholarly Virtues** are tracked for each student. While these virtues typically go up, they can sometimes go down. Advisors submit student names for consideration in advancement in these virtues, which grow in a system that parallels learning levels. Basically, to achieve the next learning level, a student needs to advance in each of the five virtues (unless special circumstances warrant something different).
