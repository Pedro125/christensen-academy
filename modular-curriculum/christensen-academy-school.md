##Founding Tenets
* K-Life
  * We never stop learning.
  * Schools are communities of learners
  * Life-long learning should mean active involvement in a school community as a learner for life.
* Family Enrollment
  * Children (under age 14 or so, must have the parents/guardians at school as well)
* Everyone is a learner (teachers, admins, lunch ladies, facilities, parents, etc.)
* Modules
  * Self-paced
  * Relatively short: 20-50 hours of work to complete. Shorter for young kids.
  * Parent and Guardian
  * Pass-fail/mastery
  * content-delivery via system not teacher
  * teacher as coach, not content-deliverer
  * creative, real-world application of knowledge to complete a module
  * portfolio + summative assessment + interview = module completion
* Age-level curriculum (not self-paced)
  * 1-3 hours a day
  * Similar to grade levels, but only for some subjects and only in certain areas. Some room for electives here, but not much. Most freedom comes in the self-paced modules.
  * Lots of this curriculum involves special lectures, field trips, inquiry-based learning, etc. Because learning content is not the focus here, this curriculum offers the best of what the current model hopes to be.
* Internships are a big part of the school life. Because of the self-paced nature of most schoolwork, internships are easy to complete.
* Credentialing philosophy that puts the burden of proof on the student. Portfolio + interview scheme.
* Academic competitions
  * Similar to the role of athletics today...
  * Gives focus and purpose to the self-paced learning.
* The Arts (for all ages)
  * For children and adults alike, it is important to continue to engage with visual and performing arts throughout
* Sports (for all ages)
  * Based on age-groups
  * Adults have opportunities too
* People in the school advance along four tracks:
  * Abilities as a learner (after reaching certain

    * Designer and facilitator of group learning experiences (level 1, 2, 3, 4) We want people who know how to design and facilitate
  * Content qualified to teach
* Pay Structure:
