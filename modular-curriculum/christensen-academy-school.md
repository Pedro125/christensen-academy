##Learning Philosophy
Learning happens through experience.

##Tutoring Philosophy
The best tutoring happens in the presence of a non-threatening, positive relationship. The best tutors are great listeners. They are able to identify a learner's prior knowledge, detect misconceptions, and guide a learner towards deep understanding of the topic at hand. The best tutors help leaner's sharpen their problem-solving skills and get them to think about problems in new ways. The best tutors are humble and honest about their own incomplete understanding of the world.

##Inquiry Teaching Philosophy
This is basically the philosophy we wrote for ESD and makes sense for group-paced modules.

##Content Teaching Philosophy
This is the traditional craft of teaching and many of the things I've learned and am still learning from my YouTube experience. The art of explaining concepts and helping students make meaningful connections is extremely important.

##Coaching Philosophy
It's all about learning... The Play Like a Champion stuff from Notre Dame is pretty awesome...

##Module Design Philosophy
Modules are based around products, which can be improved through iterative processes. This is essential for the future of education to continually make progress. Our current methods of research and classroom implementation are unlikely to yield anything but modest improvements in education...

Modules are mostly self-paced. Jesse Schell's writing on game design is essential here. Module design is all about crafting a system that is likely to yield great educational experiences.

The nature of how students complete modules changes as they advance learning levels, but a guiding principle is that the burden of proof for learning should shift from teacher to student. Throughout a module, a student must build a portfolio showcasing his or her work. Modules should tend to culminate with more authentic, open-ended, creative projects, which are even more proof of learning. However, the portfolio is really just an application of sorts for completing a module. Other forms of summative assessment will be combined as well. The portfolio is the work you need to do before you are allowed to fight the final boss...

Backwards design is used, which means that the learning objectives for modules will be very clear. This creates a market for module designers to compete in. Each module designer wanting to create the best module... Schools could approve multiple modules

##Interscholastic Gaming Philosophy
While learning for learning's sake is great, some extra motivation through friendly competition has a huge opportunity to supercharge students' motivation for learning.

##Founding Principles that deviate from the traditional model.
* K-Life
  * Not just for kids
  * Learners of all ages are part of the school community, and as such they are given opportunities to represent the school on athletic, academic, and artistic teams.
  * A strong push for parents to be active learners in the community as well
* Modular Curriculum
  * Cohesive units of study that can be mastered, often in a self-paced fashion, that are often built around *products*
  * Philosophical shift: the burden of proof falls on the learner
  * Facilitated by a coach
  * creative, real-world application of knowledge to complete a module
  * portfolio + summative assessment + interview = module completion
* No Grade Levels
* No Graduation
* Earn Learning Degrees that serve as credentials for content mastery
  * Philosophically, the degree is backed by the community. It is a statement from the community saying, "Yes, this person really did learn this content, and they learned it with what we considered to be sufficient depth."
  * All students earning degrees have truly mastered the content at an "A" level. No partial mastery is accepted.
* Earn **Learning Levels** that serve as credentials for quality of learner. Levels are also major milestones in a learner's career, comparable to graduating to the next level of school, except that one's level is more a mark of distinction and comes with new privelages. Advancing a learning level is a rite of passage and comes with great ceremony. It is an achievement. The school community is recognizing a learner for having grown in the **5 Scholarly Virtues** (described below).
  * **(Level 1) Young Learner:** Fewer self-paced modules. Self-paced modules are shorter (2-10 hours for completion). Majority of learning is lead by a teacher who leads students through authentic inquiry.
  * **(Level 2) Novice Learner** More self-paced modules and more opportunity to choose modules. Module coach plays less hands-on role.
  * **(Level 3) Intermediate Learner:** Even more self-paced modules and almost full choice over modules. Coach is very hands-off.
  * **(Level 4) Advanced Learner:** Full freedom to explore and complete modules and even "off-road" into uncharted learning territory and still earn credit, though mastery must still be assessed by others. Ability to join a learning guild, although learning guilds must always be composed of at least three master learners.
  * **(Level 5) Master Learner:** This is the highest level attainable and signifies special status in a learning guild. No restrictions on learning methods that can be credentialed. Learning can be self reported and self evaluated, though it must still be approved by one's learning guild.
* **5 Scholarly Virtues** are tracked for each student. While these virtues typically go up, they can sometimes go down. Advisors submit student names for consideration in advancement in these virtues, which grow in a system that parallels learning levels. Basically, to achieve the next learning level, a student needs to advance in each of the five virtues (unless special circumstances warrant something different).
  * **Integrity**: Master learners are able to more or less self-credential, though this must be approved by their learning guild. High levels of integrity as judged by the community are a must.
  * **Independence**: This is important for being able to succeed on self-paced modules
  * **Self Knowledge**: The goal is shift the burden of proof of learning from the teacher to the student, to get the student to be able to self evaluate. This requires self knowledge.
  * **Ingenuity**: Producer vs. consumer + creativity with a practical twist
  * **Collaboration**: Part of a learning community...
* Earn Teaching Levels that serve as credentials for abilities as a teacher based on an apprentice-journeyman-master model
  * Tutor: ...for one-on-one interaction where the tutor helps the learner develop understanding of a concept. Even young kids can be tutors at the apprentice level
  * Inquiry Teacher: More prevalent at the younger ages, a teacher guides students through inquiry
  * Content Teacher: The content-deliverer, which whill often take a video format
  * Coach: The person leading students through self-paced modules, the nature of which will vary according to student levels (i.e., advanced students will need little coaching).
  * Module Designer: The person who crafts and iteratively refines learning modules, which are often designed to be self-paced.
  * Interscholastic Game Designer: The person who creates and organizes academic competitions and other activities between schools.
* Advisory System
  * Each day, significant time is spent as a small community of learners and their advisor working on self-paced modules.
  * Multiple advisories in the same room at the same time working self-directedly. This allows teachers to work together.
* Empowerment over Coersion
  * Students have large amounts of choice within learning modules, but they also have large amounts of choice over what learning modules to pursue. Because learning modules are relatively short and self-paced, there is lots of flexibility here.
  * No grade levels and little attempt to move students together all at the same pace, although some modules are intentionally group-paced. Low and high students alike are finally allowed to soar to their greatest heights
  * No teacher is capable of weilding the great pedagogical hammer of education lore to beat knowledge into student's heads
* Fexible Schedule enabled by self-paced modules that allows for inquiry-based, real-world learning experiences.
  * Focus on getting outside the school building into the real world. Because self-pace modules allow teachers to play the role of a coach, teachers' time is freed up to plan and implement a greater diversity of learning experiences.
* Real-world work experience through internships can fit alongside self-paced modules.
  * Even young students should be engaged in real work at least some of the time. Child labor is a good thing if done right.
* Leader in academic competitions
  * Similar to the role of athletics today...
  * Gives focus and purpose to the self-paced learning.
  * Like advisory time for self-paced learning, there is time every day for self-paced learning on competition teams that are preparing for academic competitions.
* Promotion of the Arts
* Promotion of Athletics
