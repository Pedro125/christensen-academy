#Modular Curriculum
The Christensen Academy is quickly evolving into a modular system, with YouTube playlists as the basic module. Modules are often structured around projects, but this isn't always the case. There are two main purposes for this document. First, this document describes the ideal structure of the Christensen Academy as a sandbox learning system built around modules. Second, this document describes how the Christensen Academy could be used to support a modular curriculum implementation in an actual school.

##Motivation
Modular curriculum is about giving people control over their educational destinies. It's about devising a better system built on the principles of autonomy and mastery. It's about leveraging technology in an intelligent way that allows us to completely transform the traditional model of education.

In the past, our rigid model of education was a logistical necessity. Today, however, it feels more like an an interesting challenge to overcome. We can be more flexible, helping every student reach their greatest potential.

Of course, changing the model for an entire school would be foolhardy in the absense of either desparation or compelling evidence in favor of a new model. However, experimenting with a new model inside of a relatively small and isolated department (i.e., the computer science department), carries relatively little risk and high potential reward.

##On-Demand Video
On-demand video is better than traditional in-class lecture for both teachers and students in almost every way imaginable.

###For Teachers
Before I list some of the major benefits of teaching through video recording, I want to give a quick overview of the basic process I go through as I'm recording.



##Overview of the System
This is my attempt to describe a curriculum based not on courses and grade levels but on modules, self-pacing, and mastery. I hope to provide some insight into the logistical feasibility of such a curriculum. I believe this can work, and I believe it can work tremendously well.

The computer science curriculum would literally become a map of modules. The following is an example of what that map might look like for modules related to learing how to develop websites:

![](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/raw/master/modular-curriculum/web-modules.png)

On the map above are the names of seven modules. The top two in blue are starting locations. The bottom module in orange is special in that completing it fulfills the programming graduation requirement. The numbers to the right of each module indicate credit. 10 points earned equates to 0.5 credits (the graduation requirement) in the current system. Thus, there are technically no courses in the modular curriculum, only suggested paths. So long as a student completes modules totaling at least 10 points and one of those modules is flagged as fulfilling the programming requirement, that student will have fulfilled his or her computer science graduation requirement. The average student should be able to accomplish this in a little less than a semester.

There are two big ideas here:

1. Self Pacing: Students would work through their chosen path in a truly self-paced fashion. Those are ready to race ahead can sprint until they finish, run out of gas, or... well, actually I imagine some of them will just keep on sprinting. Those who need more time can take it at no penalty or added worry.
2. Mastery: Students only complete modules once they've demonstrated true mastery as judged by the teacher. In this way, the only grade is an "A", but it must be truly earned.

In this system, taking a computer science *course* would actually make no sense. Students would not sign up to take Web Design, Flash, or Java as they have in the past. Instead, students would sign up for a general computer science class period. Within a given class, some students might be learning Java programming, some might be learning how to make games with Game Maker, and other might be learning how to develop websites. Each student would be working through a personalized modular curriculum.

Note: Students would be highly encouraged (if not required) to form small learning teams (2-3 people) with which work throughout their individualized curricular journey.

##Benefits
* Flexibility in scheduling
* Heightened student control and ownership of learning
* Heightened mastery and depth of learning
* Greater opportunity for students to excel and push their limits to the max
* A clear demonstration of an innovative spirit and leadership in education

##Drawbacks
The only real drawback I see is that if we did an aweful job with this and people got upset. I doubt this will happen, however, because it is offering something positive to all parties involved.

##Completing a Module
Completing a module means demonstrating true mastery, which is impossible to define in a precise, quantifiable fashion. This will naturally look different for each module, but my early thoughts on the matter are that this can be accomplished through two main mechanisms: summative assessments and portfolios.

###Summative Assessments
There needs to be a summative assessment of some kind at the end of each module. Personally, I would lobby for old-school oral exams. Without delving into detail, I'll simply say that I think this would work quite nicely logistically.

###Portfolio
Working through a module would be much more than watching videos. There would be various challenges (i.e., assignments) throughout the journed, most of which will have strong ties to 21st century skills. Also, most modules would be framed around one or two major projects. In this case of an HTML module, for example, students would be learning HTML in the context of building a website. The website itself along with other little assignments along the way would combine to form the portfolio for that module.


##Implementation Timeline
###Spring 2013 First Trial
I'll be able to implement a modular, self-paced course by this time. It's possible that I'll be ready to do this for all three of my courses. Being constrained to the traditional grading system, I won't be able to make it purely mastery-based like I'd want to, but that shouldn't be too big of a problem. Self-pacing is more important at this point anyway because it proves that the modules are good enough to be completed in a self-paced fashion.

###Fall 2013 Second Trial
By the fall 2013 semester, I think I could comfortably try a mixed classroom where I have students going through, for example, Web Development modules and Flash modules at the same time.

###Spring 2014 Full Implementation
I think our goal should be to try something innovative as early as possible. I genuinely believe we can pull this off. Again, from the risk-reward perspective, this seems like a no-brainer.

Note: I think the AP course and robotics would have to still go the traditional route. The former for AP reasons and the latter for parts and pieces reasons. Everything else, however, could operate out of a modular system.

##Long-Term Vision
Within 10 years, free, high-quality, on-demand educational experiences will be available to anyone with an Internet connection. In such a world, there will be little tolerance for (a) passive learning experiences in a traditional classroom and (b) a curriculum that attempts to move all students together through a system at the same pace. This, I think, will be especially true in STEM areas.

If this is true, we need to start finding ways to experiment with new models of education that are more flexible. The computer science department, I think, is the perfect testing grounds. We have the personnel and expertise to pull it off and make it a tremendously successful endeavor. Instead of waiting the future to force us to change, I think we should act now and set ourselves up to be leaders in education.

##Record Keeping
We'll eventually want to develop a unified software platform, but we'll have to do most of it by hand to start. If we have good curriculum map created, it should be a simple matter of tracking student module completion. No other data, it seems, would be relevant since completion is based on mastery.

Modules will inevitably change over time. Some will be deleted. Others will be added. The system will evolve, but I highly doubt there will be any changes significant enough to cause much of a problem with the record keeping system.
