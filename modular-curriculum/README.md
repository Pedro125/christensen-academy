#Modular Curriculum
This document lays out my preliminary plan for adopting a modular curriculum within the computer science department. It describes (in detail) the nature of such a system and discusses related benefits, drawbacks, and challenges. These are just my early thoughts on the matter...

##Overview of the System
The computer science curriculum would literally become a [map]() of modules. The following is an example of what that map might look like for modules related to learing how to develop websites:

 Students in a computer science classroom would move through modules at their own pace and even be given some control over the choice of their path. Completion of a module requires thorough demonstration of mastery. Earning an "A" in a module is the only way to complete it. Each module is worth a certain number of points. Ten points equates to 0.5 credits, which is the current graduation requirement for computer science. Furthermore, 

Note: Modular curriculum is feasible only because it uses on-demand video as the primary content-delivery mechanism. Other learning experiences, challenges, and projects are still crafted by an in-person instructor, but it is on-demand video that allows for true self-pacing through the curriculum.





##Long-Term Vision
Within 10 years, free, high-quality, on-demand educational experiences will be available to anyone with an Internet connection. In such a world, there will be little tolerance for (a) passive learning experiences in a traditional classroom and (b) a curriculum that attempts to move all students together through a system at the same pace. This, I think, will be especially true in STEM areas.

If this is true, we need to start finding ways to experiment with new models of education that are more flexible. The computer science department, I think, is the perfect testing grounds. We have the personnel and expertise to pull it off and make it a tremendously successful endeavor. Instead of waiting the future to force us to change, I think we should act now and set ourselves up to be leaders in education.





The major benefits include
* Flexibility in scheduling
* Heightened student autonomy
* Heightened mastery and depth of learning
* Greater opportunity for students to excel and push their limits to the max

The drawbacks are not really drawbacks at all, but logistical and pedagogical problems to solve. I believe that compelling solutions exist, which I hope to highlight in this document.
