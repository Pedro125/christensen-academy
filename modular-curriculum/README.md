#Modular Curriculum
This document lays out my preliminary plan for adopting a modular curriculum within the computer science department. It describes (in detail) the nature of such a system and discusses related benefits, drawbacks, and challenges. These are just my early thoughts on the matter. I'm writing this mostly as food for thought and to spark a discussion.

##Motivation
The world of education is changing more than people realize. 2012 has been marked by the advent of some amazing (and free) online learning platforms (Khan Academy, Coursera, Udacity, EdX, etc.) that give students around the world on-demand access to high-quality educational experiences. In fact, I would argue that most of these experiences are superior to those being offered in traditional classrooms. There are many reasons for me saying this, but perhaps the most important is the simple fact that they put the student in control of the learning process like never before.

Instead of arguing over whether traditional or block scheduling will allow us (the teachers) to provide the best education to our students, we need to shift our perspective towards creating a more flexible model that allows and motivates our students to actively achieve the best education that the world has to offer. I'd like to suggest that this is not possible in the current model which attempts to move all students forward at a fixed pace. In the past, this rigid model was a logistical necessity. Today, however, this is no longer the case. We can do better.

Of course, changing the model for an entire school would be foolhardy in the absense of either desperation or compelling evidence in favor of a new model. However, experimenting with a new model inside of a relatively small and isolated department (i.e., the computer science department), carries relatively little risk and high potential reward. I firmly believe that even an attempt at implementing the modular curriculum I propose in the rest of this document would benefit our school and mark us as a leader and pioneer in the world of education.

##Overview of the System
The computer science curriculum would literally become a map of modules. The following is an example of what that map might look like for modules related to learing how to develop websites:

![](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/raw/master/modular-curriculum/web-modules.png)

On the map above are the names of seven modules. The top two in blue are starting locations. The bottom module in orange is special in that completing it fulfills the programming graduation requirement. The numbers to the right of each module indicate credit. 10 points earned equates to 0.5 credits (the graduation requirement) in the current system. Thus, there are technically no courses in the modular curriculum, only suggested paths. So long as a student completes modules totaling at least 10 points and one of those modules is flagged as fulfilling the programming requirement, that student will have fulfilled his or her computer science graduation requirement. The average student should be able to accomplish this in a little less than a semester.

There are two big ideas here:

1. Self Pacing: Students would work through their chosen path in a truly self-paced fashion. Those are ready to race ahead can sprint until they finish, run out of gas, or... well, actually I imagine some of them will just keep on sprinting. Those who need more time can take it at no penalty or added worry.
2. Mastery: Students only complete modules once they've demonstrated true mastery as judged by the teacher. In this way, the only grade is an "A", but it must be truly earned.

In this system, taking a computer science *course* would actually make no sense. Students would not sign up to take Web Design, Flash, or Java as they have in the past. Instead, students would sign up for a general computer science class period. 


##Completing a Module
Completing a module means demonstrating true mastery, which is impossible to define in a precise, quantifiable fashion. This will naturally look different for each module, but my early thoughts on the matter are that this can be accomplished through two main mechanisms: summative assessments and portfolios.

## Benefits
* Flexibility in scheduling
* Heightened student autonomy
* Heightened mastery and depth of learning
* Greater opportunity for students to excel and push their limits to the max

The drawbacks are not really drawbacks at all, but logistical and pedagogical problems to solve. I believe that compelling solutions exist, which I hope to highlight in this document.

###Summative Assessments
there needs to be a summative assessment of some kind at the end of each module. Personally, I would lobby for old-school oral exams. Without delving into detail, I'll simply say that I think this would work quite nicely logistically.

Secondly, since computer science learning tends to have a strong creative component where students are actually producing original work, I think it would make most sense to have 




##Long-Term Vision
Within 10 years, free, high-quality, on-demand educational experiences will be available to anyone with an Internet connection. In such a world, there will be little tolerance for (a) passive learning experiences in a traditional classroom and (b) a curriculum that attempts to move all students together through a system at the same pace. This, I think, will be especially true in STEM areas.

If this is true, we need to start finding ways to experiment with new models of education that are more flexible. The computer science department, I think, is the perfect testing grounds. We have the personnel and expertise to pull it off and make it a tremendously successful endeavor. Instead of waiting the future to force us to change, I think we should act now and set ourselves up to be leaders in education.

##Record Keeping
We'll eventually want to develop a unified software platform, but we'll have to do most of it by hand to start. If we have good curriculum map created, it should be a simple matter of tracking student module completion. No other data, it seems, would be relevant since completion is based on mastery.

Modules will inevitably change over time. Some will be deleted. Others will be added. The system will evolve, but I highly doubt there will be any changes significant enough to cause much of a problem with the record keeping system.
