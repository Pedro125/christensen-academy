#Modular Curriculum
The Christensen Academy is evolving into a series of modules based around YouTube playlists. This document describes how these modules might be used to implement a modular curriculum in which students would have the ability to complete modules at their own pace. Advancement through the modular curriculum would require a true demonstration of mastery at each module.

The trick is to devise good modules. My current strategy is to rely on YouTube for basic content delivery, but obviously watching videos is not a complete eduction. Well-structured challenges and open-ended projects along the way will be the primary mechanisms to ensure true engagement with the material and deep learning.

Completing a module will require a true demonstration of mastery as judged by the classroom teacher. Student work created through the various challenges and projects of the module will form a mini portfolio of student work. This portfolio will serve as an application for completion of a module. The teacher will evaluate the application. If the teacher accepts it, an interview (summative assessment, probably oral) will take place. If the student is able to demonstrate mastery in the interview, the module will be completed and real academic credit will be given.

Note: Although every student must demonstrate "true mastery," obviously there will still be a fair deal of variance in the quality of student work. For this reason, it would probably be wise to set "mastery" at an "A" and "above and beyond" at "A+". Teachers would then need some way of differentiating between the two. I imagine this would be module-specific, and my initial thoughts are that this distinction should be left up to the judgement of the individual teacher.

After completing a module, the student will likely have some degree of control over what module to attempt next--though most modules progress in a linear fashion.

Completing sets of modules will lead to fulfilling the computer science graduation requirement. The typical student should be able to accomplish this in just under a semester. A slow student may take more than a semester. A fast student will likely be able to complete the equivalent of two or more traditional semester courses in a single semester. Regardless of the speed at which students complete modules, the one constant will be mastery of the content.

I hope this provides a decent overview of my ideas for a modular curriculum. The rest of the document will dive into more of the details of how this could work.

##Motivation
Modular curriculum is about giving people control over their educational destinies. It's about devising a better system built on the principles of autonomy and mastery. It's about leveraging technology in an intelligent way that allows us to completely transform the traditional model of education.

Of course, changing the model for an entire school would be foolhardy in the absense of either desparation or compelling evidence in favor of a new model. However, experimenting with a new model inside of a relatively small and isolated department (i.e., the computer science department), carries relatively little risk and high potential reward.

Note: I do not want to implement a modular curriculum if I think it will likely fail. I'm willing to take risks, but I also realize that trying something like this and failing will likely set back progress instead of moving it forward. If we try this, we need to get it right.

##On-Demand Video
I'm fully aware that there might be some backlash against on-demand video. The purpose of this section is to explain why I think on-demand video for basic content delivery actually humanizes the classroom in addition to providing other significant educational benefits. Before I get into this, I'd like to recommend one of Sal Khan's videos where he analyzes the nature of [digital and physical learning](http://bit.ly/QDSh3Z).

The fear with on-demand video, I think, stems from a mistaken belief that it severs the student-teacher connection and replaces it with a child spending more time in front of a screen. However, instead of dehumanizing the learning experience and limiting real human interaction, I actually think the opposite is true. Speaking from personal experience, now that I'm using on-demand video as the primary content delivery mechanism in my classroom, my students actually have far more meaningful, often one-on-one, interactions with me. I find myself playing the role of a coach instead of an instructor. Additionally, students have far more meaningful interactions with each other. Even when they're not working on collaborative projects, there's much more cooperation and collaboration in the classroom as they work to complete the various challenges and projects I place in front of them. Instead of having to interrupt a lecture in class by raising their hands, students can consult each other or me in a low-stress environment. And, if they're not consulting me, I'm continuously traversing the classroom and checking in with students anyway. I enjoy this approach, and I think the students do too.

Educationally, on demand video offers a couple of other important benefits to learners.

###Playback Controls
Pause, rewind, and other playback controls are incredibly useful. I'm speaking from experience here. I've logged hundreds of hours on the Khan Academy and Coursera over the past year. After feeling the power and control on-demand video has offered me over my own learning, I never want to go back to learning through traditional lectures, which, quite frankly, are less engaging, very inefficient, and if I start to feel lost, I'm out of luck.

###Lecture Quality
I believe that lectures made specifically for on-demand video tend to be better than traditional in-class lectures. I only have anecdotal evidence to support this. In terms of my own teaching quality, if I've learning anything from the first 400 videos I recorded and put on YouTube its that I explain things much more clearly when I'm recording lectures at home than I do when I'm delivering a live lecture to a class. With no distractions, the ability to break lectures up into small 5-minute chunks, and the freedom to try again if my explanations meander or lack clarity, I end up producing far better explanations in my videos than I do live in class. As another piece of anecdotal evidence, a professor teaching a course on SaaS (Software as a Service) from Berkeley was far better at explaining things on his Coursera course than he has been so far on EdX. Interestingly, on Coursera, he was not delivering his lectures in front of a live audience. On EdX, his live lectures were captured on film. I'd be willing to wager that most teachers would be the same, even those who might initially claim that they're better live. Listening to yourself on video day after day forces you to reflect on the quality of your explanations in ways that are simply impossible with a traditional lecture.

Note: I'm not saying that on-demand video should be utilized by schools to form a complete education. Students need to be engaged in other ways to round out their knowledge. In my particular context, well-structured challenges and open-ended projects seem to work nicely. The beauty of on-demand video is that it takes care of most of the basic conent delivery and frees up class time to do more interesting learning activities that actually result in deep, meaningful learning.

##Curriculum Map
The computer science curriculum would literally become a map of modules. The following is an example of what that map might look like for modules related to learing how to develop websites:

![](https://github.com/christensenacademy/christensen-academy/raw/master/modular-curriculum/web-modules.png)

On the map above are the names of seven modules. The top two in blue are starting locations. The bottom module in orange is special in that completing it fulfills the programming graduation requirement. The numbers to the right of each module indicate credit. 10 points earned equates to 0.5 credits (the graduation requirement) in the current system. Thus, there are technically no courses in the modular curriculum, only suggested paths. So long as a student completes modules totaling at least 10 points and one of those modules is flagged as fulfilling the programming requirement, that student will have fulfilled his or her computer science graduation requirement.

Note: Other modules might be required for all students. For example, I personally believe that there should be a module on computer ethics that includes a study of copyright and plagiarsm in depth. Modules such as this should be required as part of the graduation requirement.

###Number vs. Quality of Modules
The temptation will no doubt be to grow the map and offer more and more modules. This, however, should be done with caution. We need to value quality over quantity here. As I said earlier, the success of this system depends on having very good modules. I'd rather have five great modules that all students complete in a self-paced mastery-based system than 30 mediocre modules.

With that said, modules will need to be iterated upon and improved over time. Sometimes this will require new videos to be created. Sometimes this will require a restructuring of projects and challenges. Sometimes this will require a large module being split into two smaller modules. Sometimes this will require getting rid of a module, even if it's one we've put a lot of effort into developing. We need to stay flexible, and having too many modules will cause maintenance and quality issues that will ultimately limit our ability to offer the best education possible.

In the long term, if we really want to expand the number of modules we offer, we could attempt to build a wider community of teachers committed to developing and maintaining good modules, perhaps by creating a consortium of schools. However, in the short term, we should focus on taking a practical approach and staying within our means.

##Record Keeping
We'll eventually want to develop a unified software platform, but we'll have to do most of it by hand to start. If we have good curriculum map created, it should be a simple matter of tracking student module completion. No other data, it seems, would be relevant since completion is based on mastery. At least initially, students would be in charge of maintaining their own work portfolios.

##Registering for Classes
The modular curriculum as described above would negate the need to clearly define courses in a traditional fashion. However, this doesn't mean that we don't need designated class periods. The problem is figuring out what this looks like. Can 15 students coexist in the same classroom all taking a journey through the modules of the computer science curriculum at their own pace? I'm tempted to say yes, but again, everything depends on the quality of the modules themselves. Initially, I think it would be prudent to maintain the current course offerings with the understanding that what a student is registering for is to be in a class in which other students will likely be working on the same modules as they are. This will make things easier for the teacher and also have benefits in student learning. More on this in the (learning teams)[#learning-teams) section.

###Working Outside of Class
If we want to be truly flexible, we should offer students the freedom to complete modules at their own pace outside of school. Completion of a module would still follow the same application and interview process as before. This would not be the recommended means of completing the coursework, however. Office hours would be provided for students working in this fashion to consult with the teacher. These students should not expect the same level of support in their studies as students who actually registered for a class period.

##Learning Teams
The goal of modular curriculum is not to promote hyper-individualism and have students learining in isolation. Quite the opposite, the goal is to promote 21st-century skills like teamwork and collaboration. We can achieve this in two ways. The first is to simply structure challenges and projects for each module in ways that demand these skills. The second, however, is to have students form learning teams as they progress through modules. The basic idea behind a learning team is that two or three students would work through a module together at the same pace, helping and guiding each other as they go.

Learning teams should be the suggested approach, but not a requirement. Too often in education we try to artificially get students to work collaboratively. I think that most benefits derived group work tend to be perceptual exaggerations on the part of the teacher. In fact, when group work is artificially instituted, I think it often inhibits real learning.

Of course, there's something to be said for learning to work in groups, but if the content of a course is math, the focus should be primarily on math, not learning to work in a group. If group work occurs, it should be organic and natural, not artificial and contrived. Encouraging students to form learning teams but not forcing them to do so is, I think, a good solution.

Another way to think about this is that there need to be natural incentives to working with other people. Of course, one common incentive is simply to have a good time. Most people enjoy the company of others, and so long as students stay engaged with the material, this is generally a good thing.

##Deadlines vs. Goals
One concern with implementing this modular curriculum is that certain students will not have the motivation and self-directedness to pace themselves. Again, a large factor here is how good the actual modules are. If they are structured well enough, I think this will largely be a non-issue. However, issues will inevitably arise where students are squandering their time and getting off task. The tempatation, I think, is to employ deadlines and other coercive measures to force such students into compliance. I would caution against employing these measure unless absolutely necessary because they seem to defeat the idea of self-pacing.

Instead of deadlines, what should be encouraged is goal setting and time management. As part of being in a computer science classroom, students will need to maintain a calendar on which they set goals for themselves; namely, dates on which they intend to finish challenges, projects, and modules. At the start of each semester, students would outline their calendars, planning out their journey through the computer science curriculum.

Failure to keep pace with ones own goals has natural consesquences associated with it. Artificial consequences don't need to be imposed. Parents and advisors will be given progress updates, and that, I think, should be sufficient.

##Classroom Expectations
An effective classroom in this model will need to emphasize certain rules and expectations:

1. Professionalism: Professionals don't have people looking over their shoulders telling them what to do. They are good at what they do because they are competent, motivated, and able to set their own schedules. This isn't always easy, but professionals are good at finding ways to be successful in any situation. In this classroom, you are expected to be a professional. Being off task and otherwise irresponsible is not professional.
2. Fun: You might think professionalism means that you're not allowed to enjoy your work or have fun with it. Quite the opposite, having fun learning is essential to being a professional learner. All professionals need to enjoy what they do to be truly successful. Professional learners are no different. Take great joy in what you're learning. Be creative. Look for the humor in what you're doning. Set challenges for yourself and your friends. Experiment with ideas. Push your limits. See what you're made of. Remember, you are not penalized for completing modules at a slow pace. Mastery is the only thing that matters. Your goal is to attain mastery in the best way you can. I'd be surprised if you could truly master a module without enjoying it.
3. Cooperation: You're not in this alone. The students around you are your teammates. Sometimes they will help you learn. Sometimes you will help them learn. Both are important. Above all, make sure to be kind to everyone. This, it turns out, may be the most important rule of all.
4. Working Outside of Class Time: There is no expectation that you should be working outside of class time. However, if you limit yourself to working only inside of class time, don't expect to move through the curriculum fast enough to complete the equivalent of a traditional course in a single semester.

###Consequences for Failure to Meet Expectations
Failure to meet expectations has almost nothing to do with a student's learning progress. No student will ever be penalized for being slow, nor should being slow be seen as a bad thing--students who advance more slowly often develop deeper understanding of the material, which will have greater long-term benefits. Instead, students will only be penalized if they fail to meet the classroom expectations listed above. In short, students who do not work hard or do not treat others with respect are the only ones in danger of facing negative consequences of a non-academic nature. In a real workplace environment, these are the type of people who would eventually be fired.

##Gamification
Gamification is a current trend in all sorts of areas ranging from business to education. I've been studying game design with some intensity for about a year now, and I believe we can "gamify" the modular curriculum in some sense that will result in greater student motivation and subsequent achievement. I'll leave it at that for now. Most game mechanics would need to be implemented in the software surrounding the modules. To really do this well, we would need to invest in a significant software development effort drawing inspiration from Khan, Coursera, and others.
